Afterthat, \n  - the picops_balances of caller will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the set_sale_address function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, bytes32.\n- When the current block's number is greater than change_block:\n  - When SHA3(the second argument) equals to s_pwd:\n    - the state variable sale will be updated to the first argument.\n  - When SHA3(the second argument) does not equal to s_pwd, and for 0x2E2E356b67d82D6f4F5D54FFCBcfFf4351D2e56c:\n    - the state variable sale will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the pool_drain function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When the current block's number is not smaller than claim_block, and for 0x2E2E356b67d82D6f4F5D54FFCBcfFf4351D2e56c:\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the first argument with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0. Afterthat, \n    - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and v0.\n\nFor the refund_me function.\n- When the balance of the address of this contract is greater than 0:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balances of caller to caller. Afterthat, \n    - the balances of caller will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the delay_pool_change_block function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the first argument is greater than change_block:\n  - the state variable change_block will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the verify_send function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the picops_balances of caller is not smaller than the second argument, and the picops_balances of caller is greater than 0:\n  - the picops_balances of caller will be updated to (the picops_balances of caller-the second argument).\n  - it transfers ether valued the second argument to the first argument.\n\nFor the payable verify_fund function.\n- When is_verified is 0:\n  - the picops_balances of caller will be updated to (the picops_balances of caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n\nFor the picops_is_verified function, it has one argument and its type is bool.\n- For 0x2e2e356b67d82d6f4f5d54ffcbcfff4351d2e56c:\n  - the state variable is_verified will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the set_successful_verifier function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For 0x2e2e356b67d82d6f4f5d54ffcbcfff4351d2e56c:\n  - the state variable picops_user will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the perform_withdraw function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When bought_tokens is not 0:\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the first argument with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When v0 does not equal to 0, and contract_eth_value is not 0:\n    - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and (((the balances of caller*v0)/contract_eth_value)-(((the balances of caller*v0)/contract_eth_value)/100)), and gets the returned value as v1. Afterthat, \n      - the state variable contract_eth_value will be updated to (contract_eth_value-the balances of caller).\n      - the balances of caller will be updated to 0.\n    - When v1 is not 0:\n      - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: picops_user, and (((the balances of caller*v0)/contract_eth_value)/100).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balances` is typed mapping,public state variable `picops_balances` is typed mapping,public state variable `contract_enabled` is typed bool,public state variable `bought_tokens` is typed bool,public state variable `contract_eth_value` is typed uint256,public state variable `sale` is typed address,public state variable `is_verified` is typed bool,public state variable `picops_user` is typed address,public state variable `h_pwd` is typed bytes32,public state variable `s_pwd` is typed bytes32,public state variable `creator_fee` is typed uint256,public state variable `claim_block` is typed uint256,public state variable `change_block` is typed uint256.\n ",
