It includes a constructor that sets the initial owner, and a series of public functions that implement the described behavior. \n\nPlease note that the contract assumes that the `msg.sender.call{value: amount}(\"\")` calls will always succeed, which may not be the case in real-world scenarios. In a production environment, you should handle potential call failures appropriately. Please also note that all the transactions are payable and hence, they can receive and send Ether.",
