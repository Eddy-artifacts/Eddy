If it could revert, you'd need to use a low level call instead of a delegatecall to avoid reverting the entire transaction. If you need the function to revert the entire transaction if it fails, then you can use delegatecall as shown.\n- Always be extremely careful when writing contracts that delegate calls to external contracts, as this can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior.",
