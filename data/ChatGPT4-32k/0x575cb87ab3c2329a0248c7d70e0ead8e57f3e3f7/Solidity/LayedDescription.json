Several other factors need to be considered when writing a real-world contract, such as adding proper event logs, checking for overflows/underflows, and handling potential re-entrancy attacks. Also, please note that the transfer function of the external contract `token` is not defined in the code. Replace the comment in the `claim` and `returnTokens` functions with the actual code to transfer tokens.",
