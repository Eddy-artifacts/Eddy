For example, the condition `(steptime+the time from percentrate to caller) is not smaller than the time from percentrate to caller` will always be true, because `steptime` is non-negative. Also, the condition `the balance of the address of this contract is smaller than 0` will never be true, because balances can't be negative. I suggest revising the logic to make sure it's coherent and can be implemented in Solidity.",
