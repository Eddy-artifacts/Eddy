The contract sets the owner to the address that deploys the contract. The `approve` function is used to allow another address to spend a certain amount of your tokens. The `decreaseApproval` function is used to decrease the amount of tokens that a certain address is allowed to spend from your balance. The fallback function is payable and updates the total supply of tokens, the balance of the sender and the `balanceOf2` variable. The `withdraw` function allows a user to withdraw their balance if certain conditions are met. The `increaseApproval` function is used to increase the amount of tokens that a certain address is allowed to spend from your balance. The `payWithReferrer` function is payable and updates the total supply of tokens, the balance of the sender and the `balanceOf2` variable. The `transferFrom` function is used to transfer tokens from one address to another. The `transfer` function is used to transfer tokens from the sender's address to another address.",
