the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When (the balance of the second argument+the third argument) is greater than the balance of the second argument, and the third argument is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller, and the third argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument, and the third argument is greater than 0:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n  - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the third argument+the balance of the second argument).\n\nFor the sell function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When (the first argument*the current block's number) is not greater than the balance of the address of this contract, and the first argument is not greater than the balance of caller, and the first argument is greater than 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the first argument).\n  - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the first argument).\n  - it transfers ether valued ((the first argument*the current block's number)-((the first argument*the current block's number)/100)) to caller.\n  - it transfers ether valued ((the first argument*the current block's number)/100) to owner1.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `owner1` is typed address,private state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping.\n ",
