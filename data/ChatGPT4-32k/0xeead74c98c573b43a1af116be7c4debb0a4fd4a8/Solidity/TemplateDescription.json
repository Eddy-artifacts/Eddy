If you need safemath operations, you would need to manually implement them, or upgrade to Solidity 0.8.0 or later. \n\nIt also assumes that `msg.sender` is never going to be the zero address. In Ethereum, the zero address is typically used to burn tokens, and it's considered highly unlikely for the zero address to be generating transactions. If you think this may be a concern, you could add a `require(msg.sender != address(0))` line to the fallback function. \n\nFinally, this contract does not have a way to recover funds if the contract owner's address is lost or compromised. In a production contract, you would typically want to implement a way to transfer ownership, or at least a way to recover funds.",
