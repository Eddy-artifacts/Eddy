It also sets the jackpot to 0.\n\nThe reset function can only be called by the owner and it transfers all the ethers held by the contract to the owner.\n\nThe fallback function is a payable function which increases the jackpot by the value sent with the transaction and increases the totalSupply by 1. It then calculates a hash value using the current time, the caller's address multiplied by a large constant, and the totalSupply. If the hash value modulo 778 is equal to 666, 555, 444, 333, 222 or 111, it transfers 5% of the contract's balance to the caller and 1% of the contract's balance to the owner. If the hash value modulo 778 is equal to 777, it transfers 50% of the contract's balance to the caller and 1% of the contract's balance to the owner.",
