The `advSend` function uses call function and the `abi.encodePacked` function to construct the data to send in the external calls. The length of the data to send is checked as requested. Please note that the function signatures mentioned in the description are not valid Solidity function signatures and were replaced with a hashed \"0x0002\" string.",
