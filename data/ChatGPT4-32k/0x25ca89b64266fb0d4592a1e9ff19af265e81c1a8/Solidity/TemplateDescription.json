The `sweep` function transfers the entire balance of the contract to a specified address. The `transferOwnership` function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new owner. The `advSend` function allows the owner to send ether to a specified address and call a function on that address.\n\nPlease note that this code doesn't check if the address is empty before transferring ether, and it doesn't have overflow or underflow checks. It is important to add these checks for security.",
