If the transfer is successful and the exchange rate is not zero, it then transfers the equivalent amount of Ether to the caller by calculating `_amount / exchangerate`.\n\nThis contract assumes that the token contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and that the `transferFrom` function returns a non-zero value on success. \n\nAlso, be aware that this contract does not check whether it has sufficient balance to make the Ether transfer. You need to make sure that the contract has enough Ether to cover the transfer. \n\nMake sure to replace the pragma version with the one that fits your project.",
