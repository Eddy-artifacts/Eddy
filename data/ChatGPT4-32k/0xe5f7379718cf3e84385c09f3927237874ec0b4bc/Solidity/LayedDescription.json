The provided solidity code is a simplification of the logic. The contract includes the `ERC20Token` standard functions such as `approve`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approveAndCall` and a payable fallback function. The `approveAndCall` function calls an external contract with the function signature `0xx1000000`. However, the actual function to be called at this address is not specified in the task description, so this part of the logic is left out.",
