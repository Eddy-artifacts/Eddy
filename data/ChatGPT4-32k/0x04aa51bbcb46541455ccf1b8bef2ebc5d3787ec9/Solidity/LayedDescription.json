				"content": "Here is a simplified Solidity contract based on your provided description. Please note that I'm simplifying it for the sake of readability and the actual implementation might differ based on the exact use-case.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceof;\n    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;\n    uint256 public totalsupply;\n    string public name;\n    string public symbol;\n    uint8 public decimals;\n    address public owner;\n    uint256 public pool;\n    address public token;\n    address public compound;\n    address public fulcrum;\n    address public aave;\n    address public aavetoken;\n    address public dydx;\n    uint256 public dtoken;\n    uint8 public provider;\n    address public apr;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        provider = 0;\n        if (msg.value == 0) {\n            // Your complex logic here\n            // Simplified for readability\n            decimals = 8;\n            symbol = \"0\";\n        }\n        name = \"0\";\n    }\n\n    function renounceOwnership() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Not the owner\");\n        owner = address(0);\n    }\n\n    function set_new_DTOKEN(uint256 _dtoken) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Not the owner\");\n        dtoken = _dtoken;\n    }\n\n    function set_new_COMPOUND(address _compound) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Not the owner\");\n        compound = _compound;\n    }\n\n    function set_new_APR(address _apr) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Not the owner\");\n        apr = _apr;\n    }\n\n    // Other functions go here\n}\n```\n\nThis is a simple contract where the owner can change the dtoken, compound, and apr variables. The payable constructor sets the provider to 0 and does a few other assignments.\n\nPlease note that you have a complex logic around SHA3 which isn't explained in detail, so I can't provide the exact implementation of that. You might want to use the keccak256 function in Solidity for SHA3 hashing.\n\nThe other functions you mentioned are also not fully detailed, so I can't provide their implementations. For example, you're mentioning external contracts like aave, but it's not clear what these contracts are or what functions they have. Similarly, for functions like getAave and getAaveCore, it's not clear what they're supposed to do. If they're just getters for the aave variable, then you wouldn't need them because the aave variable is public.",
