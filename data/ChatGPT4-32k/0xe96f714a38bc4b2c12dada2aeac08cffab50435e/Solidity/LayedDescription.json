Furthermore, it is not clear how to handle the returned value v0 from the external contract's function call, or what the external contract's burnAndRetrieve function does.

Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the state variable totalSupply1 will be updated to 200.\n- the state variable rate will be updated to 35.\n\nFor the payable payFeesInEther function.\n- When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+totaletherconsumed) is not smaller than totaletherconsumed:\n  - totaletherconsumed will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+totaletherconsumed).\n  - When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+frozenether) is not smaller than frozenether:\n    - frozenether will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+frozenether).\n\nFor the thaw function.\n- When (thawingdelay+lastthaw) is not smaller than lastthaw, and frozenether is greater than 0, and after (thawingdelay+lastthaw):\n  - the state variable lastthaw will be updated to current time.\n  - When totalSupply is not 0:\n    - the state variable totalSupply2 will be updated to totalSupply.\n  - When (frozenether+liquidether) is not smaller than liquidether:\n    - thisauctiontotalether will be updated to (frozenether+liquidether).
