Also, the external function `0x19457468` should be properly implemented in the caller's contract. This contract code doesn't handle the case where the caller's contract doesn't contain the `0x19457468` function or if the function doesn't execute correctly.\n\nThe `withdraw` function updates `used` only if all the checks pass and the external function call is successful. It's important to ensure that the `validator` address is set to `0` and the length of the `data` byte array is not `65`. If any of these conditions are not met, the function will revert.",
