Due to the complexity of the requirements, implementing all functions is beyond the scope of this context. However, this gives you an idea of how you could begin to implement such a contract in Solidity. The contract starts with a constructor that initializes the contract's state variables. The setPrices function allows the contract owner to update the prices used for buying and selling tokens. The approve function allows a user to approve another address to spend a certain amount of their tokens.",
