Notably, the `lockContract` function sets `lockcontract` to \"0\", resets the `totalSupply`, and then sets `lockcontract` to \"1\". The `modifyToken` function sets `last_completed_migration` to the address passed as an argument. The `setRate` and `setEthUsd` functions set `rate` and `ethusd`, respectively, based on complex conditions. Finally, the `destroy` function destroys the contract and sends its balance to `totalSupply`.",
