It also has functions to set the `owner` and `authority` addresses, with checks to ensure only the current `owner` or an authorized address can do so. The `getMoney` function transfers the contract's balance to the `owner`, with similar authorization checks. The `canCall` function is a private helper function used to make calls to the authority contract and decode the returned value.",
