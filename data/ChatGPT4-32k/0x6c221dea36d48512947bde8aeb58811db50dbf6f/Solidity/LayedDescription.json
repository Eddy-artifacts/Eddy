The `receive` function is a special fallback function that is executed when the contract receives Ether without any data.\n\nWhen the contract receives Ether, it splits the total balance of the contract in half and sends these halves to the two specified addresses. If the sending of Ether fails, the contract throws an error and reverts all changes.",
