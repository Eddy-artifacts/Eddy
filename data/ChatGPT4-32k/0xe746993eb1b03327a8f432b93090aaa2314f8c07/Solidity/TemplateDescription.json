				"content": "Here's a Solidity contract that meets most of the specifications you've described:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract InvestmentContract {\n    address private owner;\n    uint256 private totalSupply;\n    uint256 public investedamount;\n    uint256 public payedamount;\n    uint256 public daysafterstart;\n    address private token;\n\n    constructor(address _token) public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        token = _token;\n    }\n\n    function investorsCount() public view returns(uint256) {\n        return IToken(token).investorsCount();\n    }\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        if (msg.value == 0) {\n            uint256 v0 = IToken(token).dividends(msg.sender);\n            require(v0 <= address(this).balance, \"Insufficient contract balance\");\n            if (v0 > 0) {\n                IToken(token).updateCheckpoint(msg.sender);\n                payable(owner).transfer(v0 / 25);\n                payable(msg.sender).transfer((v0 * 24) / 25);\n                payedamount += v0;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() public {\n        uint256 v0 = IToken(token).dividends(msg.sender);\n        require(v0 <= address(this).balance, \"Insufficient contract balance\");\n        if (v0 > 0) {\n            IToken(token).updateCheckpoint(msg.sender);\n            payable(owner).transfer(v0 / 25);\n            payable(msg.sender).transfer((v0 * 24) / 25);\n            payedamount += v0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function getDividends(address user) public view returns(uint256) {\n        return IToken(token).dividends(user);\n    }\n\n    function getDeposits(address user) public view returns(uint256) {\n        return IToken(token).sumOfDeposits(user);\n    }\n\n    function getDividendsWithFee(address user) public view returns(uint256) {\n        return IToken(token).dividends(user);\n    }\n}\n\ninterface IToken {\n    function investorsCount() external view returns(uint256);\n    function dividends(address user) external view returns(uint256);\n    function updateCheckpoint(address user) external;\n    function sumOfDeposits(address user) external view returns(uint256);\n}\n```\n\nThis contract currently does not handle all the operations described in the specifications. Some of the operations are very complex and would require a more sophisticated contract design. Also, it seems that the `token` contract should have methods like `addDeposit`, `addReferrer` and `r`, but they are not included in the `IToken` interface because they were not fully described in the specifications.\n\nNote that this contract uses the `fallback` function to handle incoming Ether transfers. If Ether is sent to this contract and `msg.value` is zero, the contract will call the `dividends` and `updateCheckpoint` functions on the `token` contract and transfer 4% of the dividends to the `owner` and 96% to the sender.\n\nThe `withdraw` function performs a similar operation but it is called manually by the users.\n\nThe `getDividends`, `getDeposits` and `getDividendsWithFee` functions simply call the corresponding functions on the `token` contract and return the results.\n\nPlease note that this contract doesn't handle the `invest` function as it wasn't fully described in the specifications. Also, this contract doesn't handle the `r`, `addDeposit` and `addReferrer` operations on the `token` contract as they weren't fully described in the specifications. \n\nFor full functionality according to your specifications, you'd need to provide more details about these operations. For example, what do the `r`, `addDeposit` and `addReferrer` functions do? What are their arguments and return values? What's the logic behind the repeated calls to `r` and `amountOfDeposits` in the `invest` function? These details are necessary to implement the full contract functionality.\n",
