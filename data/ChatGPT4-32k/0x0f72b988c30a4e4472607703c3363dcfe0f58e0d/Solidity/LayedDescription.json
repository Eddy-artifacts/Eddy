For example, I assumed that 'owner' is the one who deploys the contract and has the ability to pause and unpause the contract. I also assumed that 'token' and 'whitelist' are addresses of other contracts that this contract interacts with. You may need to adjust the code to fit your specific requirements.\n\nThis code is a starting point and does not include all the functionality you described. It also does not include any safety checks or error handling. You should add these in your final code.",
