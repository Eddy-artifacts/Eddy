				"content": "Based on the provided description, below is a smart contract written in Solidity that handles the logic:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address public fallback;\n\n    function() external payable {\n        if (msg.data.length > 4 && msg.data[0] != 0xa6 && msg.data[1] != 0x19 && msg.data[2] != 0x48 && msg.data[3] != 0x6e) {\n             (bool success,) = fallback.delegatecall(msg.data);\n             require(success, \"Failed to delegate call\");\n        } else {\n            revert(\"First argument must not be 0xa619486e\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a payable fallback function. The condition checks if the first four bytes of `msg.data` are not equal to `0xa619486e`. If the condition is true, it delegates a call to the `fallback` address with all the arguments, otherwise it reverts the transaction. \n\nPlease note that in Solidity, `msg.data` is an array of bytes which contains the function signature and the parameters. The first four bytes (0 to 3) of `msg.data` is the function signature. Therefore, in the condition we are checking the first four bytes of `msg.data`. \n\nAlso note that the `delegatecall` function is dangerous and should be used carefully as it can change the state of the contract which is calling the function.",
