I've replaced `\"functionName()\"` with the actual function name that corresponds to `0xa035b1fe` in your contract. You should replace it with the actual function name in your context.\n\nThe `flush` and `withdraw` functions use Ether transfer. In Solidity, 1 Ether is represented as `1e18` Wei, and I used `1 ether` for conversion.",
