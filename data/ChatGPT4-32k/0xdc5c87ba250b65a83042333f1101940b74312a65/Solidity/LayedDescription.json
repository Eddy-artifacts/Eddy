The `refund` function checks if the caller has a non-zero balance, and if so, transfers ether to the caller and sets the balance to zero. It then makes an external function call to the contract at the `token` address. The `purchase` function checks if the caller has a zero balance and if the sent value is greater than or equal to the price. If these conditions are met, it makes an external function call and sets the balance of the caller to one.",
