In the constructor, which is payable, these variables are assigned the values you specified. Note that the constructor is payable, which means it can receive Ether when the contract is deployed, but your description did not specify any logic related to this Ether, so the contract simply accepts it without doing anything with it.\n\nRemember that in real development situations, you should always include checks, balances, and security measures to ensure your contract behaves as expected and is secure.",
