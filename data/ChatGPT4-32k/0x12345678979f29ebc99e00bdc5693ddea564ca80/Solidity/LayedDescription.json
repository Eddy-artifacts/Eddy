The transferTokens, depositERC20Token, emergencyReleaseERC20Token, transferTokensTwice, withdrawERC20Token, exchangeTokens functions are placeholders and need to be implemented according to your business logic. Also, please note that the getOwner and contractApproved functions are assumed to be present in the contract at address 0x12345678982cB986Dd291B50239295E3Cb10Cdf6. If these functions are not present or have different signatures, the staticcall will fail.",
