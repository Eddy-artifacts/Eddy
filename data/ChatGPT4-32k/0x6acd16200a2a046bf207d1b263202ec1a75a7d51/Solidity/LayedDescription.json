The `contractowner` is set in the constructor to be the account that deploys the contract. \n\nThe `withdraw` function checks if the sender is the `contractowner` before allowing the withdrawal of all ether from the contract. \n\nThe `update` function accepts an argument `_dappID` and is `payable` meaning it can accept ether. The function first checks if the ether sent with the transaction (`msg.value`) is more than `0x6c00a3912c000`. If it is, it increments the corresponding `totalheartsbydappid` by `msg.value`, then sends half of `msg.value` to the `lastaddress`, and finally updates `lastaddress` to the sender of the transaction (`msg.sender`).",
