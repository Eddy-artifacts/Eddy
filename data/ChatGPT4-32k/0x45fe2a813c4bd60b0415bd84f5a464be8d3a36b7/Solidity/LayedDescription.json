The functions include access control checks to ensure that only the `transfer` address can execute certain operations. Each function updates the state variables as described, and the `approve` function updates the `allowance` mapping. \n\nNote: The contract is incomplete and the code for each condition in the constructor is not provided due to the complexity and unclear nature of the conditions. Further clarification on the conditions would be required to fully implement this contract.",
