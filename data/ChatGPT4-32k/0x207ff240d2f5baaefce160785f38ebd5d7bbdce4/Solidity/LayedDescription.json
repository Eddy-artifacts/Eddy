A bid function is used for bidding during the auction. An auctionEnd function is used to end the auction and transfer the highest bid to the beneficiary. A withdraw function is used to withdraw funds by the bidders. Please note that this contract does not handle possible re-entrancy attacks and other security issues, and it's meant for demonstration purposes only.",
