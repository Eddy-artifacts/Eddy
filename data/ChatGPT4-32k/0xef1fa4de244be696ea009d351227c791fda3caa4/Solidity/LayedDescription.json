The usage of `SHA3` (which is not directly available in Solidity) and various bitwise operations don't make sense in the context given. Furthermore, the `balanceOf` function is missing in this contract. It should be implemented in the contract at address `0x5491305204DaCa75317A0bC8C332dD61Dbb77Bc8`. The code also assumes that the `s_4` and `s_6` mappings are from address to uint256.",
