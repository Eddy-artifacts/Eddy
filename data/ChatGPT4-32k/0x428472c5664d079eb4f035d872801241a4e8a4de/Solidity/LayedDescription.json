It first checks if the sent Ethers are greater than the `currentinvestment`.\n- If the condition is met, the Ethers valued `currentinvestment` are transferred to `currentinvestor`, and then `currentinvestor` and `currentinvestment` are updated to the caller and the sent Ethers respectively.\n- We use `payable(address)` to convert `msg.sender` to an address payable because in Solidity 0.8.0 `msg.sender` is not payable by default.\n- Please make sure to handle the scenario where `currentinvestor` might be a zero address. Here, I added a condition to only transfer when `currentinvestor` is not a zero address.",
