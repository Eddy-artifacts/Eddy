The `renounceOwnership` function can be called only by the owner and it sets the owner to the 0 address. The `setAddressSingleTxMaxUsedInSwapping` function can also be called only by the owner and it sets the `_limitationsinmaxslotsusedinswappingtx` variable to the value passed as a parameter. The `approve` function updates the allowance mapping to permit a certain address to spend a certain amount on behalf of the caller.",
