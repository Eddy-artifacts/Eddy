Note that the `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to some functions to the contract owner only. The `wager`, `donate`, and `play` functions are payable, meaning they can receive Ether. The `transferAnyERC20Token` function uses low-level calls to interact with another contract. Also, the `play` function uses the keccak256 hash function for randomness.",
