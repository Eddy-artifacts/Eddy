As per your specifications, the contract uses `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` or `.send()`, and it checks for potential underflows/overflows before making transfers. Additional requirements ensure that the contract has enough funds before making a transfer and that the function caller sends an acceptable Ether amount. \n\nPlease note that the `send` function does not prevent re-entrancy attacks. To prevent such attacks, you should consider using a mutex or the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Also, the Solidity version 0.6.12 is outdated. You might want to update to a later version, like version 0.8.4.",
