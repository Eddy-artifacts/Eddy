The constructor sets the owner to the address that deploys the contract. The fallback function is payable, meaning it can receive Ether. It updates the `balanceOf1` mapping with the current timestamp and the `balanceOf` mapping with the amount of Ether sent. \n\nIf the amount of Ether sent is greater than 0, it transfers 4% of that Ether to the owner. If the balance of the sender is not 0, it calculates a value based on the balance of the sender and the time since their last transaction, then transfers that amount of Ether to the sender. \n\nIf the calculated value is greater than the contract's balance, it simply transfers the entire contract balance to the sender.",
