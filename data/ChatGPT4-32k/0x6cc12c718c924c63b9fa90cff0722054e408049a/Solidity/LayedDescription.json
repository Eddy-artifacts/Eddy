The contract includes four functions (`dev_e`, `admin_fin`, `dev_u`, and `Acquire_Coins`) that implement the provided logic. There is also a fallback function to receive Ether.\nPlease note that the `selfdestruct` function is used in the `admin_fin` function, which can permanently destroy the contract and send its balance to the provided address. Use this function with caution.",
