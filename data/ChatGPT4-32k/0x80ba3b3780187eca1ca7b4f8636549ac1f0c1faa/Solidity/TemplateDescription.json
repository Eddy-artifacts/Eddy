The `WithdrawEther` function allows the owner to withdraw Ether from the contract. The `SetPrice` function allows the owner to change the sell price. The `BuyToken` function allows users to buy tokens from the contract. The `WithdrawToken` function allows the owner to withdraw tokens from the contract. The `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer ownership of the contract. The `SetMinLot` function allows the owner to set the minimum lot size. The fallback function calls the `BuyToken` function if Ether is sent directly to the contract.",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

it transfers ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*5)/1000) to 0x574c4DB1E399859753A09D65b6C5586429663701.\n- When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/sellprice) is greater than minlot:\n  - it calls an external function transfer of 0x8b0e368aF9d27252121205B1db24d9E48f62B236 with the following argument list: caller, and (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/sellprice), and gets the returned value as v1.\n  - When v1 is not 0:\n    - it transfers ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*800)/1000) to 0x4dF46817dc0e8dD69D7DA51b0e2347f5EFdB9671.\n    - it transfers ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*100)/1000) to 0xd58f863De3bb877F24996291cC3C659b3550d58e.\n    - it transfers ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*5)/1000) to 0x574c4DB1E399859753A09D65b6C5586429663701.\n\nFor the WithdrawToken function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - it calls an external function transfer of 0x8b0e368aF9d27252121205B1db24d9E48f62B236 with the following argument list: owner, and the first argument.\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the SetMinLot function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- For owner, and the first argument is not smaller than 5:\n  - the state variable minlot will be updated to the first argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `sellprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `minlot` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
