It includes the constructor, fallback, safeKill, initialize, and safeWithdrawal functions. Note that 'selfdestruct' is used in the safeWithdrawal function to destroy the contract and send remaining funds to the owner. Please, review this contract carefully before deployment as it's quite complex and involves various conditions.",
