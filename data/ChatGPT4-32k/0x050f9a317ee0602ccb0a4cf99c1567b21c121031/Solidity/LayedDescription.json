				"content": "Sure, here is a simple example of how you might accomplish this in Solidity:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.7.1;\n\ncontract DelegatecallContract {\n    address public target = 0x0dE8bf93dA2f7eecb3d9169422413A9bef4ef628;\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        (bool success,) = target.delegatecall(msg.data);\n        require(success, \"Delegated call failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the `fallback` function is made `payable` to allow it to receive Ether. The `delegatecall` function is then used to delegate the call to the target contract at `0x0dE8bf93dA2f7eecb3d9169422413A9bef4ef628` with all of the arguments (`msg.data`). The `delegatecall` function returns a boolean indicating whether the call was successful and a bytes variable that contains the return data.\n\nIf the `delegatecall` function fails for any reason, the contract reverts with the message \"Delegated call failed\". This is important to ensure that any errors in the delegated call do not go unnoticed.\n\nPlease replace the target address with the correct address as necessary.",
