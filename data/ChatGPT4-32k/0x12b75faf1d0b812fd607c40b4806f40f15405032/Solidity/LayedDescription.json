For the `transfer` function of the `tokenreward` contract, you need to define an interface. \n\nPlease note that this contract does not include any security measures apart from simple checks for ownership. It's always recommended to follow best security practices while writing smart contracts. Also, the contract does not emit any events, which can be useful for tracking state changes. For a production-level contract, you might want to add these features.",
