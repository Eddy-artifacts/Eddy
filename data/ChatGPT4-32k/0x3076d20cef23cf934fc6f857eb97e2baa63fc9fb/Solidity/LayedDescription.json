It also assumes `IERC20` is a standard ERC20 token interface with added `burn` function.\n\nKeep in mind, this is a basic version of your contract and you should thoroughly test it before using it on a live network. This code does not implement any security measures (like re-entrancy guard) and doesn't have any events to help track contract state changes. It also lacks any input validation and error handling.\n",
