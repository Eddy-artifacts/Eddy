Complex conditions mentioned in the description are not covered in the function definitions. They can be added based on the actual business requirements.\n2. Solidity does not support nested mappings directly. Hence, `bytes`, `bytes32`, `bool`, `int`, `string`, `add`, and `uintstorage` are declared as mappings with `bytes32` keys.\n3. Solidity does not support dynamic byte arrays in the calldata location, so I used `bytes calldata` in the `setBytes` function.\n4. The `withdraw` function uses `keccak256` to generate the hash.",
