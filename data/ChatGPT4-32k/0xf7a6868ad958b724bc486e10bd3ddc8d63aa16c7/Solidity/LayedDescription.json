the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n  - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the third argument+the balance of the second argument).\n\nFor the UnlockAccount function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - the balance2 of the first argument will be updated to the balance2 of the first argument.\n\nFor the increaseApproval function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When (the second argument+the allowance from caller to the first argument) is not smaller than the allowance from caller to the first argument:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the allowance from caller to the first argument).\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the balance of caller is not smaller than the second argument, and istradeable is not 0, and the balance2 of the address is 0, and (the balance of the first argument+the second argument) is greater than the balance of the first argument:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `istradeable` is typed bool,private state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf2` is typed mapping.\n ",
