The `payout` function sends the entire balance of the contract to the provided address if it's not zero, otherwise, it sends the balance to the CEO address. The `buyVotes` function allows users to purchase votes. The number of votes purchased is equal to the amount of ether sent divided by `0x38d7ea4c68000`, and these votes are added to the vote count for the provided index.",
