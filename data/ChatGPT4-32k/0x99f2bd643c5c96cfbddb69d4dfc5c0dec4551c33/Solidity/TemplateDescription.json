				"content": "Based on your requirement, here is a simple Solidity smart contract that has a payable fallback function which delegates a call to a specific address.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    // The target address to delegate calls to\n    address payable target = 0x391a04311E0BFC913ef6fa784773307C826104F0;\n\n    // The fallback function is executed when a contract receives Ether without data\n    fallback() external payable {\n        // Ensure the target address is not null\n        require(target != address(0), \"Target address cannot be 0\");\n\n        // Delegate the call to the target\n        (bool success, ) = target.delegatecall(abi.encodePacked(msg.data));\n        require(success, \"Failed to delegate the call\");\n    }\n\n    // The receive ether function is executed when a contract receives Ether with data\n    receive() external payable {\n        // Nothing to do\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract does not perform any arithmetic operations, so there's no need to check for underflows or overflows. It also doesn't make use of `ecrecover`, `keccak256`, `sha256`, `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, `blockhash`, or the specific constant `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`.\n\nPlease note that the `delegatecall` function is dangerous and should only be used if you know what you're doing. It changes the context of the current contract to the called contract, which can modify your contract's state.",
