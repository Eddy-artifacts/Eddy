				"content": "Sure, here is a basic contract using Solidity that includes the payable fallback function, which makes a delegate call to a specified address:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.7.0;\n\ncontract Proxy {\n    address payable private _owner;\n    address private _implementation;\n\n    constructor(address implementation_) {\n        _owner = msg.sender;\n        _implementation = implementation_;\n    }\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        _delegate(_implementation);\n    }\n\n    function _delegate(address implementation) internal {\n        assembly {\n            calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())\n            let result := delegatecall(gas(), implementation, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)\n            returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())\n\n            switch result\n            case 0 { revert(0, returndatasize()) }\n            default { return(0, returndatasize()) }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this contract, the `_delegate` function is used inside the fallback function to delegate the call to the `_implementation` address. The `_implementation` address is set in the constructor at the time of contract deployment. Please replace the `_implementation` address with `0x391a04311E0BFC913ef6fa784773307C826104F0` as per your requirement.\n\nThe `fallback` function is marked as `payable` so it can receive Ether. The `fallback` function is executed if the contract is called and no other functions match the specified function identifier, or if no data is supplied.\n\nPlease note that the use of inline assembly is not recommended for routine smart contract coding as it bypasses several important safety features of Solidity. It's necessary here for the lower-level `delegatecall` function.",
