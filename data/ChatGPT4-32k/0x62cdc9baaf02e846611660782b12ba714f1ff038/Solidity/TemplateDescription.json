The payable constructor receives ether and updates `balance` to true and `owner` to the sender if no ether was received. The kill function sets `balance` to false and transfers the balance of the contract to the `owner`. The takeAGuess function receives ether and a guess number. If the guess number is correct, it transfers 90% of the contract balance to the sender and the remaining balance to the `owner`.",
