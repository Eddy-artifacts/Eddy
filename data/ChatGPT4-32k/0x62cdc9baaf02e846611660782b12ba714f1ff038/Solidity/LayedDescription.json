The constructor is payable and sets the balance to true. If the constructor received no ether, the owner is set to the sender of the transaction.\n\nThe `kill` function checks if the balance is not zero and if so, transfers the balance of the contract to the owner and sets the balance to zero.\n\nThe `takeAGuess` function takes a guess (uint8) as an argument. If the guess equals the result of a certain calculation, the balance is not zero and the ether sent with the transaction equals a certain value, then a certain amount of ether is transferred to the caller and the rest is transferred to the owner. The balance is then set to zero.",
