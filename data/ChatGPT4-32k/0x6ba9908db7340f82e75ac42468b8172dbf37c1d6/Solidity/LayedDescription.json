The amount of ether sent is added to the user's balance in the `hodlers` mapping.\n\nUsers can then call the `party` function to withdraw their balance, but only if they have a positive balance and if the current block's timestamp is greater than `0x5b89d680`. If these conditions are met, the balance is transferred back to the user and the user's balance in the `hodlers` mapping is reset to zero.",
