				"content": "Sure, here is a basic Solidity contract that fits your description:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    address private owner;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function destroy() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can destroy the contract\");\n        selfdestruct(payable(owner));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a constructor that sets the contract's `owner` to the address that deploys the contract. It also has a `destroy` function that can only be called by the `owner`. When called, it destroys the contract and sends the remaining Ether balance to the `owner`. \n\nPlease note that `selfdestruct` should be used with caution as it can have unintended consequences if not handled properly. It is also worth mentioning that `selfdestruct` is not recommended for use in new contracts according to the Solidity documentation.",
