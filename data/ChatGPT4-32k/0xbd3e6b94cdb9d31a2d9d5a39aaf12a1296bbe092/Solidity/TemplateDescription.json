The constructor of the contract sets the owner to the sender of the transaction that created the contract. \n\nThe contract also has a payable fallback function that is executed when someone sends Ether to the contract. It transfers 1/20th of the received Ether to the owner, updates the balance and balance2 mapping for the sender of the transaction. If the sender's balance is not zero, it also transfers a reward to the sender and updates the balance and balance2 again.\n\nPlease note that the contract doesn't implement any logic to prevent overflow or underflow as mentioned in the programming specifications. This would require some additional functions to safely perform addition and multiplication.",
