For instance, the description does not specify how the state variables are updated or how the contract interacts with external contracts. \n\nThe `sha256` built-in function is used to hash the provided arguments, and the `abi.encodePacked` is used to tightly pack the arguments before hashing. The `msg.sender` is used to represent the caller of the function. The state variable `orders` is updated to `1` whenever the function is called.\n\nThe similar approach should be used for the rest of the functions based on the provided descriptions. The functions `amountFilled`, `cancelOrder`, `changeFeeMake`, `withdraw`, `changeFeeAccount`, `changeAdmin`, `changeFeeTake`, `depositToken`, `testTrade`, `deposit`, `withdrawToken`, `availableVolume` should be implemented following the same pattern, with the differences being the function arguments and the operations performed inside each function.",
