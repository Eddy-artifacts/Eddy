It includes functions for approving transfers (approve), making transfers (transfer), making transfers from another address (transferFrom), burning tokens from the caller's balance (burn), and burning tokens from another address's balance (burnFrom). Some safety checks are included to prevent underflows and overflows and to ensure the caller has enough balance or allowance for the requested operations.",
