Afterthat, \n    - the balance of 0x103B4e7f316a058a3299e601dff7e16079B72501 will be updated to totalsupply.\n  - the state variable paused will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When the second argument does not equal to 0, and the third argument is not greater than the balance of caller, and the third argument is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller:\n  - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the first argument does not equal to 0, and the second argument is not greater than the balance of caller:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,private state variable `totalSupply2` is typed uint256,private state variable `paused` is typed bool,public state variable `price` is typed uint256.\n ",
