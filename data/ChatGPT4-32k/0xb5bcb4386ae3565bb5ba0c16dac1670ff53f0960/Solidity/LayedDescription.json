				"content": "Based on the given contract logic and the state variables, the Solidity contract will look something like this:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract DelegateCallContract {\n    address private constant targetAddress = 0xEE2c03CEd8b6755E8d76aB144677F5f350203CAB;\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        (bool success,) = targetAddress.delegatecall(msg.data);\n        require(success, \"Delegate call failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a fallback function that is marked as `payable` which means it can receive ether. If any function that does not match with any of the existing functions is called or ether is sent without data, then the fallback function will be called.\n\nThe `delegatecall` is a low level function similar to `call`. When contract A executes `delegatecall` to contract B, B's code is executed with contract A's storage, `msg.data`, and `msg.sender`. This means that a `delegatecall` allows an account to break the isolation between contracts and directly access the storage of the calling contract, which can be a security risk if not handled properly.\n\nIn this contract, we have a `delegatecall` to a target address with all the arguments. The target address is a hardcoded address where the delegate call will be made. The `msg.data` is given to the `delegatecall` function which contains all the arguments of the function that was originally called. If the `delegatecall` fails for any reason, an error message \"Delegate call failed\" is thrown.\n\nPlease note that using delegatecall can be dangerous and should be done with caution.",
