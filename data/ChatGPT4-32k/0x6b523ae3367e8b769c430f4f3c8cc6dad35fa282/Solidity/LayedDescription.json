The `withdrawEth` function sends all Ether held by the contract to the specified address. The `withdrawErc721` and `withdrawErc20` functions transfer all of a specified token held by the contract to a specified address. The `setGaltFee`, `setEthFee`, `setFeeCollector`, and `setFeeManager` functions all require that the caller be the current owner of the contract. The `renounceOwnership` and `transferOwnership` functions allow the owner to relinquish or transfer control of the contract.",
