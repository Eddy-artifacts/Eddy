The `checkGoalReached` function updates the `paused` state variable and checks if the `amountraised` state variable is greater than or equal to the `fundinggoal` state variable. If so, it updates the `decimals` state variable. The fallback function checks if the `paused` state variable is 0, the sent Ether (`msg.value`) equals `0xaa87bee538000`, and the sender's balance (`balanceof[msg.sender]`) equals 0. If all conditions are met, it updates the sender's balance and the `amountraised` state variable, and if the `price` state variable isn't 0, it calls the `transfer` function of the `tokenreward` contract. The `safeWithdrawal` function allows the beneficiary to withdraw the `amountraised` amount and updates the `decimals` state variable.",
