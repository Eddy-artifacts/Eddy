				"content": "Here is a sample Solidity contract based on your description:\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity ^0.6.0;\n\ninterface ITokenReward {\n    function transfer(address receiver, uint amount) external returns(bool success);\n}\n\ncontract FundRaising {\n    address public beneficiary;\n    uint256 public fundinggoal;\n    uint256 public amountraised;\n    uint256 public deadline;\n    uint256 public price;\n    address public tokenreward;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceof;\n    \n    uint8 private paused;\n    uint8 private decimals;\n    \n    constructor() payable public {\n        decimals = 0;\n        paused = 0;\n    }\n    \n    function checkGoalReached() public {\n        paused = 1;\n        \n        if (amountraised >= fundinggoal) {\n            decimals = 1;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    fallback() payable external {\n        require(paused == 0);\n        require(msg.value == 0xaa87bee538000);\n        require(balanceof[msg.sender] == 0);\n        \n        balanceof[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n        amountraised += msg.value;\n        \n        if (price != 0) {\n            ITokenReward(tokenreward).transfer(msg.sender, (msg.value / price) * 0xf4240);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    function safeWithdrawal() public {\n        require(msg.sender == beneficiary);\n        msg.sender.transfer(amountraised);\n        decimals = 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract includes a constructor, a checkGoalReached function, a fallback function, and a safeWithdrawal function according to your specifications. \n\nPlease note that the logic described assumes that some other parts of the contract (not specified in your description) will control the `fundinggoal`, `beneficiary`, `price`, and `tokenreward` variables. Moreover, the `deadline` variable has not been used in the described logic. \n\nAlso, it's important to note that fallback functions in Solidity are used as a last resort when no other function matches the given function signature, or in case there was no data supplied. \n\nThe `fallback` function is `payable` and thus can receive Ether. It includes some operations based on your descriptions, such as balance and amount raised updates and calling an external function.",
