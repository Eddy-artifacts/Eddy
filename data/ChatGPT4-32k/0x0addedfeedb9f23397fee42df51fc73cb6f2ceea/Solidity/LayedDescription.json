the state variable newowner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the transferAnyERC20Token function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- For owner, and the first argument does not equal to the address of this contract:\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: owner, and the second argument.\n\nFor the approveAndCall function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, bytes.\n- When the third argument is not greater than 0x100000000:\n  -

Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the acceptOwnership function.\n- For newowner:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to newowner. Afterthat, \n    - the state variable newowner will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the approve function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the getOraclePriceETH_USD function.\n- it delegates a call to the external contract token with the 0x59e02dd7 argument.\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable newowner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the transferAnyERC20Token function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- For owner, and the first argument does not equal to the address of this contract:\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: owner, and the second argument.\n\nFor the approveAndCall function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, bytes.\n- When the third argument is not greater than 0x100000000:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n  - When 0 is not smaller than the third argument:\n    - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n  - When 0 is smaller than the third argument:\n    - When 32 is not smaller than the third argument:\n      - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n    - When 32 is smaller than the third argument:\n      - When 64 is not smaller than the third argument:\n        - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n      - When 64 is smaller than the third argument:\n        - When 96 is not smaller than the third argument:\n          -

the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the first argument).\n  - When the first argument is not greater than the balance of caller:\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-(the balance of caller-the first argument)).\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When the third argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument, and the second argument does not equal to the address of this contract, and the second argument does not equal to 0:\n  -
