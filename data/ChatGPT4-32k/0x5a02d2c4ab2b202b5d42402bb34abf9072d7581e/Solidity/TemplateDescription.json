It includes a constructor that initializes the state variables and two functions: `withdraw()` and `AddTicket()`. The `withdraw()` function transfers the balance of the contract to `s_7_12_32`. The `AddTicket()` function is payable and updates the `totalSupply` and `totalSupply2` variables according to the conditions.",
