The example code I've provided is a skeleton that shows how to structure the contract and functions based on your descriptions. To fully implement this contract, you would need to add the logic into each function as indicated by the comments. \n\nRemember that when dealing with Ether transactions, it's important to always have fail-safe and security measures in place to protect the contract from malicious attacks. Make sure to thoroughly test the contract before deploying it to the main Ethereum network.",
