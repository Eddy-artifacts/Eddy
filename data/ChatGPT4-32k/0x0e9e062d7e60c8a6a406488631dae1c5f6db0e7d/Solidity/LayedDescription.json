The `enableContract`, `withdraw`, `pauseContract`, `changeCost` and `transferOwnership` functions all use this modifier to enforce this restriction. Note that the `transferOwnership` function also validates the input to prevent the owner from accidentally transferring ownership to the zero address.",
