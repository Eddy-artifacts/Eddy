This is done to prevent reentrancy attacks. \n\nI have also added appropriate `require` statements to enforce access control for the `setPartner` and `reFund` functions. \n\nI have used `payable` for all the addresses that need to receive ether, and marked the constructor and the fallback function as `payable` as well, so that they can receive ether. \n\nPlease note that this contract doesn't handle potential overflows or underflows in arithmetic operations. For this, you may want to use a library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath. \n\nAlso, this contract doesn't check for empty addresses before transferring ether. This is something you may want to add. \n\nLastly, please test this contract thoroughly before using it on the main network.",
