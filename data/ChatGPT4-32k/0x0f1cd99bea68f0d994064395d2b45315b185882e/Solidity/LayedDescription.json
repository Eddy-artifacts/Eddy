The `withdrawTips` function can only be called by the contract owner and transfers the total tips to the owner after resetting the tips to 0. The `Win` function can only be called by the winner after the deadline and it transfers the total reward to the winner after resetting the reward to 0. The `ClickButton` function is payable, it checks if the sent msg.value is greater than or equal to 0x38d7ea4c68000 and if the current timestamp is less than the deadline. It then updates the state variables as per the given instructions.",
