It is difficult to discern a meaningful implementation from the given instructions. Moreover, Ethereum has replaced the SHA3 function with the KECCAK256 function in Solidity. If you need to implement some sort of condition based on the `name` and `symbol` variables, you will need to provide more concrete instructions.",

Afterthat, \n    - the state variable remainingsupply will be updated to the balance of the address of this contract.\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When the third argument does not equal to 0, and the third argument is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller, and the second argument does not equal to 0, and the third argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n  - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the first argument does not equal to 0, and the second argument does not equal to 0, and the second argument is not greater than the balance of caller:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `remainingsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping.\n ",
