Then, we update `balanceOf1` with the current block number and `balanceOf` with the ether just received. After that, we calculate the transfer amount and check if the sender's balance is sufficient. Finally, we transfer the ether to the sender using `.call()` method and make sure the transfer is successful. The receive function is made payable to accept ether.",
