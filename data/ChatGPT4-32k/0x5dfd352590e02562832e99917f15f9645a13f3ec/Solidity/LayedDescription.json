it calls an external function getInterest of the external contract token with the first argument.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it calls an external function d of the external contract token with the first argument.\n    - it calls an external function c of the external contract token with the first argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `owner` is typed address,private state variable `owner2` is typed address,private state variable `owner3` is typed address,private state variable `totalSupply` is typed uint256,private state variable `token` is typed address.\n ",
