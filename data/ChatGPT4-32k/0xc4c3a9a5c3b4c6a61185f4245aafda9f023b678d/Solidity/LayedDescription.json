The `transfer` function transfers ethers to a specific address if the sent ethers are more than the fees. The `setHubrisOneFees` function sets the fees for the contract, and only the owner of the contract can set the fees. The `collect` function allows the owner to collect all the ethers in the contract. Lastly, the `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer ownership to a new address.",
