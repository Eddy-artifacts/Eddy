For instance, the `receiveEther` function is assumed to be a function that does not take any arguments and is payable. The code also assumes that `selfDestruct` should only be callable when `decimals` is true. Note that using `selfdestruct` should be done with caution, as it can have unintended side effects if not used properly.",
