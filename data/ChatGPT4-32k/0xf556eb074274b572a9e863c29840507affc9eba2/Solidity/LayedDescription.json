Due to the complexity and length of your request, it's not feasible to cover everything in one response. Furthermore, it's important to note that the SHA3 function and the EXP operation are not directly available in Solidity and would require additional logic to implement. Similarly, the fallback function and the payable constructor are not directly compatible. You cannot receive Ether in a constructor. Also, the use of SHA3 for some sort of control flow is not clear from the description.",
