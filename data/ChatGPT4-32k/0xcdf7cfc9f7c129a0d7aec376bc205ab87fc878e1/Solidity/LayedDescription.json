However, the provided `setConfig` function should give you a good idea on how to proceed with the rest of the contract functions. \nAlso, I assumed that the constructor function should be payable and the `s_0_10_32` variable was not included in the contract as it was not clearly defined in the description. The `moderators[msg.sender] = 1;` line in the constructor is assuming that the caller is the initial moderator.",
