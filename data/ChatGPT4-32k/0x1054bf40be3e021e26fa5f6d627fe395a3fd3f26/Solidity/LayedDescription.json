				"content": "Apologies for any confusion, but the logic provided seems to be quite complex and requires some clarification. Based on your description, here's a rough draft of what the Solidity contract code might look like:\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract PoohPlumber {\n    uint256 public pooh_to_call_1plumber;\n    uint256 public starting_pooh;\n    uint256 private totalSupply1;\n    uint256 private totalSupply;\n    address public ceoaddress;\n    bool public initialized;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public hatcheryplumber;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public claimedpoohs;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public lasthatch;\n    mapping(address => address) public referrals;\n    uint256 public marketpoohs;\n\n    constructor() payable {\n        require(msg.value == 0);\n        ceoaddress = msg.sender;\n        pooh_to_call_1plumber = 0x15180;\n        starting_pooh = 300;\n        totalSupply1 = 10000;\n        totalSupply = 5000;\n        initialized = false;\n    }\n\n    function seedMarket(uint256 _value) public payable {\n        require(marketpoohs == 0);\n        initialized = true;\n        marketpoohs = _value;\n    }\n\n    function getFreePlumber() public payable {\n        require(initialized && msg.value == 0x38d7ea4c68000);\n        payable(ceoaddress).transfer(msg.value);\n        if(hatcheryplumber[msg.sender] == 0){\n            lasthatch[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;\n            hatcheryplumber[msg.sender] = starting_pooh;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function hatchPoohs(address _referral) public {\n        require(initialized);\n        // Here should be the logic of the hatchPoohs function\n    }\n\n    function buyPoohs() public payable {\n        require(initialized);\n        // Here should be the logic of the buyPoohs function\n    }\n\n    function sellPoohs() public {\n        require(initialized);\n        // Here should be the logic of the sellPoohs function\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a rough draft and does not include the full logic as described. However, it should give you a good place to get started. Some of the logic described, such as updating user balances and transferring funds, requires additional information and clarification. For example, it's unclear how the `claimedpoohs` and `hatcheryplumber` variables should be updated in certain scenarios. If you could provide additional details or clarify the requirements, it would be possible to provide a more accurate contract code.",
