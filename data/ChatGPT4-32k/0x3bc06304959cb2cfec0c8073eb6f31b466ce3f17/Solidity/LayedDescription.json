Afterthat, \n      - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokencontract with the following argument list: ceoaddress, and ((4*the second argument)/100).\n    - When totalSupply is 0:\n      - When 0 is not 0, and totalSupply1 is 0:\n        - the claimedeggs of the first argument will be updated to ((0-((4*0)/100))+the claimedeggs of the first argument).\n        - When v0 is greater than 1:\n          - the claimedeggs of the first argument will be updated to ((0-((4*0)/100))+the claimedeggs of the first argument).\n      - When totalSupply1 is not 0, and 0 is 0:\n        - the claimedeggs of the first argument will be updated to (0+the claimedeggs of the first argument).\n        - When v0 is greater than 1:\n          - the claimedeggs of the first argument will be updated to (0+the claimedeggs of the first argument).\n    - When v0 is greater than 1:\n      - it calls an external function reinvest of the external contract tokencontract.\n      - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokencontract with the following argument list: ceoaddress, and ((4*the second argument)/100).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `tokencontract` is typed address,public state variable `eggs_to_hatch_1shrimp` is typed uint256,public state variable `starting_shrimp` is typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply` is typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply1` is typed uint256,public state variable `ceoaddress` is typed address,public state variable `initialized` is typed bool,public state variable `hatcheryshrimp` is typed mapping,public state variable `claimedeggs` is typed mapping,public state variable `lasthatch` is typed mapping,public state variable `referrals` is typed mapping,public state variable `marketeggs` is typed uint256.\n ",
