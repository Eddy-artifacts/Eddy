Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the external contract proxy will be updated to 0x818E6FECD516Ecc3849DAf6845e3EC868087B755.\n- the external contract token will be updated to 0x8316B082621CFedAB95bf4a44a1d4B64a6ffc336.\n- the external contract token1 will be updated to 0x89d24A6b4CcB1B6fAA2625fE562bDD9a23260359.\n- the state variable name will be updated to 0.\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is 0:\n  - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than SHA3(3):\n    - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n  - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is greater than SHA3(3):\n    - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than (1+SHA3(3)):\n      - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n    - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is greater than (1+SHA3(3)):\n      - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than (1+(1+SHA3(3))):\n        - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n      - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is greater than (1+(1+SHA3(3))):\n        - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than (1+(1+(1+SHA3(3)))):\n          - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n        - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is greater than (1+(1+(1+SHA3(3)))):\n          - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than (1+(1+(1+(1+SHA3(3))))):\n            - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n          - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is greater than (1+(1+(1+(1+SHA3(3))))), and (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than (1+(1+(1+(1+(1+SHA3(3)))))):\n            - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n\nFor the getUniswapSellPrice function.\n- it calls an external function getExchangeRate of the external contract token with the following argument list: 128, 192, 256, 0xde0b6b3a7640000, 3, 0x4554480000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 3, 0x5341490000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 21, and 0x53454c4c2d554e49535741502d45584348414e47450000000000000000000000.\n\nFor the getKyberBuyPrice function.\n- it calls an external function getExchangeRate of the external contract token with the following argument list: 128, 192, 256, 0xde0b6b3a7640000, 3, 0x4554480000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 3, 0x5341490000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 18, and 0x4255592d4b594245522d45584348414e47450000000000000000000000000000.\n\nFor the withdrawETHAndTokens function.\n- For owner:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to caller.\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token1 with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When RETURNDATASIZE is not smaller than 32:\n    - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract token1 with the following argument list: caller, and v0.\n\nFor the payable kyberToUniSwapArb function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - it calls an external function transferFrom of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, the address of this contract, and the third argument.\n  - When RETURNDATASIZE is not smaller than 32:\n    - it calls an external function watch_tg_invmru_2f69f1b of the first argument with the following argument list: proxy, and 0.\n    - it calls an external function watch_tg_invmru_2f69f1b of the first argument with the following argument list: proxy, and the third argument.\n    - it calls an external function tradeWithHint of the external contract proxy with the following argument list: the external contract token1, the third argument, 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE, the address of this contract, 0x13726987666190aeec798abe93f11d65ee7f340000000000000000, 0, 4, 256, and (name/2).\n    - it calls an external function ethToTokenSwapInput of the second argument with ether valued valued v0 and the following argument list: 1, and current time.\n    - When 31 is not smaller than (name/2), and (name/2) is not 0:\n      - it calls an external function tradeWithHint of the external contract proxy with the following argument list: the external contract token1, the third argument, 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE, the address of this contract, 0x13726987666190aeec798abe93f11d65ee7f340000000000000000, 0, 4, 256, (name/2), and name, and gets the returned value as v0. Afterthat, \n        - it calls an external function ethToTokenSwapInput of the second argument with ether valued valued v0 and the following argument list: 1, and current time.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `proxy` is typed address,private state variable `token` is typed address,private state variable `token1` is typed address,private state variable `name` is typed string,private state variable `owner` is typed address.\n ",
