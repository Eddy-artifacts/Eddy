Afterthat, \n    - the state variable pendingowner2 will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is not smaller than minpaymentwei, and ((weitotokens*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))+totaltokenssold) is not greater than maxcaptokens, and paused is 0:\n  - it calls an external function sell of the external contract token with the following argument list: caller, and (weitotokens*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)), and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When v0 is not 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - the state variable totaltokenssold will be updated to ((weitotokens*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))+totaltokenssold).\n    - the state variable totalweireceived will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+totalweireceived).\n    - the isbuyer of caller will be updated to 1.\n    - the state variable balance1 will be updated to ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/2)+balance1).\n    - the state variable balance2 will be updated to ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)-(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/2))+balance2).\n\nFor the pause function.\n- For owner1:\n  - the state variable paused will be updated to 1.\n- For users, except for owner1, and for owner2:\n  - the state variable paused will be updated to 1.\n\nFor the setMaxCapTokens function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the first argument is greater than 0:\n  - For owner1:\n    - the state variable maxcaptokens will be updated to the first argument.\n  - For users, except for owner1, and for owner2:\n    - the state variable maxcaptokens will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the addOwner function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When the ownermap of the first argument is 0:\n  - For owner1:\n    - When the first argument is not 0:\n      - the ownermap of the first argument will be updated to 1.\n    - the value the first argument will be put to the element in the ownerhistory.\n  - For owner2, and for users, except for owner1:\n    - When the first argument is not 0:\n      - the ownermap of the first argument will be updated to 1.\n    - the value the first argument will be put to the element in the ownerhistory.\n\nFor the transferOwnership2 function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner2:\n  - the state variable pendingowner2 will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the transferOwnership1 function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner1:\n  - the state variable pendingowner1 will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the withdraw1 function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When balance1 is greater than 0, and for owner1:\n  - it transfers ether valued balance1 to the first argument.\n\nFor the payable sellTokensForEth function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not smaller than minpaymentwei, and ((weitotokens*the second argument)+totaltokenssold) is not greater than maxcaptokens, and paused is 0:\n  - it calls an external function sell of the external contract token with the following argument list: the first argument, and (weitotokens*the second argument), and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When v0 is not 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - the state variable totaltokenssold will be updated to ((weitotokens*the second argument)+totaltokenssold).\n    - the state variable totalweireceived will be updated to (the second argument+totalweireceived).\n    - the isbuyer of the first argument will be updated to 1.\n    - the state variable balance1 will be updated to ((the second argument/2)+balance1).\n    - the state variable balance2 will be updated to ((the second argument-(the second argument/2))+balance2).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `owner1` is typed address,public state variable `pendingowner1` is typed address,public state variable `owner2` is typed address,public state variable `pendingowner2` is typed address,public state variable `ownermap` is typed mapping,public state variable `ownerhistory` is typed array,public state variable `paused` is typed bool,public state variable `balance1` is typed uint256,public state variable `balance2` is typed uint256,public state variable `token` is typed address,public state variable `minpaymentwei` is typed uint256,public state variable `weitotokens` is typed uint256,public state variable `maxcaptokens` is typed uint256,public state variable `totaltokenssold` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalweireceived` is typed uint256,public state variable `isbuyer` is typed mapping.\n ",
