It means that it will be executed when someone sends Ether to the contract's address. \n\nIn this function, we first check if the sender has already invested. If yes, we calculate the amount that should be transferred to the sender based on the provided formula. If the amount is greater than 0, we transfer the amount to the sender.\n\nThen, we update the `atblock` and `invested` mappings for the sender. `atblock` is updated to the current block number and `invested` is updated by adding the value of Ether just received.",
