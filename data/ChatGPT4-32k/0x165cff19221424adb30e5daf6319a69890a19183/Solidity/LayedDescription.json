The `sendEther` and `sendTokens` functions are only callable by the `owner` and they call the corresponding functions on the `token` contract. \n\nThe `IERC20` interface is used to interact with an ERC20 token contract at the specified address. Note that the actual ERC20 contract might have different function names or parameters, so you would need to adjust the interface and function calls accordingly.",
