Please note that it is a simplified version, doesn't take into account all the logic specified in the description, and may require further modifications to meet your exact requirements. This is because the logic described is complex, some details are unclear and some parts of it seem to involve operations that are not typically performed in Solidity (like using SHA3 function in certain ways). \n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.6.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    uint8 private decimals;\n    uint256 public totalsupply;\n    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceof;\n    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowance;\n    address public owner;\n    address public newowner;\n    bool public icosuccessful;\n    bool public fundsucceeded;\n    address public deposito;\n    uint256 public usdraised;\n    mapping (address => bool) public kycaddresses;\n    mapping (address => uint256) public ethercontributed;\n    string public name;\n    string public symbol;\n    address public fundwallet;\n    uint256 public end_date;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        // Update state variables here\n        owner = 0xB353cF41A0CAa38D6597A7a1337debf0b09dd8ae;\n        fundwallet = 0xCCE1F6F4CEB0F046cf57FE8E1c409Fc47AFe6Aab;\n        end_date = 0x5b928291;\n        totalsupply = 0x34f086f3b33b684000000;\n        balanceof[fundwallet] = totalsupply;\n    }\n\n    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        // Update state variables here\n        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(balanceof[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        balanceof[msg.sender] -= _value;\n        balanceof[_to] += _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    // Implement other functions here\n}\n```\nThis contract includes a constructor that accepts ether and updates certain state variables, as well as `approve` and `transfer` functions. However, the logic described in the prompt is not fully implemented as the prompt is somewhat unclear and the logic seems to involve operations that are not typically performed in Solidity (like using SHA3 function in certain ways).",
