Please note that to ensure that only `admin` can call certain functions, a modifier `onlyAdmin` is used which checks the `msg.sender` against the `admin` address. This is a common approach to handle permissions in Solidity contracts. Also, the `sha256` built-in function is used in the `order` and `amountFilled` functions to generate a hash of the provided arguments.",

When the whitelisterc20 of the first argument is not 0:\n    - the balance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the balance from the first argument to caller-the second argument).\n    - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and the second argument.\n  - When the whitelisterc20 of the first argument is 0, and the whitelisterc223 of the first argument is not 0:\n    - the balance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the balance from the first argument to caller-the second argument).\n    - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and the second argument.\n\nFor the availableVolume function, it has 10 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address, uint8, bytes32, bytes32.\n- it calls a built-in function sha256 with the following argument list: the address of this contract, the first argument, the second argument, the third argument, the fourth argument, the fifth argument, and the sixth argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n- When the call or transfer succeeds, and the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0:\n  - it calls a built-in function ecrecover with the following argument list: SHA3(0x19457468657265756d205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a3332,v0), the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `admin` is typed address,public state variable `feeaccount` is typed address,public state variable `accountlevelsaddr` is typed address,public state variable `feemake` is typed uint256,public state variable `feetake` is typed uint256,public state variable `feerebate` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `orders` is typed mapping,public state variable `orderfills` is typed mapping,public state variable `whitelisterc20` is typed mapping,public state variable `whitelisterc223` is typed mapping.\n ",
