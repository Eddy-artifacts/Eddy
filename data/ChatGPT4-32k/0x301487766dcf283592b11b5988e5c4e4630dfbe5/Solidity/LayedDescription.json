I have only implemented the `order` and `cancelOrder` functions. The full implementation would be quite extensive and would involve understanding how the rest of the functions should interact with the state variables and each other. Also, note that the `ecrecover` function is used to recover the address used to sign a message, and it's commonly used in contract methods to ensure the message was not tampered with.",
