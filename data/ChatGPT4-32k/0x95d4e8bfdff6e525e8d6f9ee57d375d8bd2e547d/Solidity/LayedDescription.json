Also, be aware of the security considerations when working with Solidity and smart contracts. Always test your contracts thoroughly before deploying them.\n\nThe contract contains six functions: answer, refund, claim, resolve, and cancel, and a constructor. Each function has specific requirements defined with the `require()` function, and they all modify the state of the contract in specific ways as described in your instructions.",
