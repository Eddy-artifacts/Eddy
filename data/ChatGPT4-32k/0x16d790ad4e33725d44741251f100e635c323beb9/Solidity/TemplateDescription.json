It also has a `transferEther` function which transfers ether to the specified address. Furthermore, it includes examples of some built-in functions and properties. The `encodeKeccakSHA256` function demonstrates the use of `keccak256` and `sha256` functions. The `recoverAddress` function illustrates the use of `ecrecover` function. The `getBlockDetails` function shows how to use `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, and `blockhash`. \n\nPlease note that I've included error handling and checks to ensure safe execution of the contract.",
