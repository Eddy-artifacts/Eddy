You can add the remaining functions by following the same pattern. The `approve` function, for example, is implemented according to the logic described. \n\nPlease note that this contract doesn't do anything useful as it is. It's just an illustration of how you could start implementing the described logic. The logic for interacting with the external contracts `token` and `token1` is not implemented because the interfaces of these contracts are not provided. You would typically interact with an external contract by first defining an interface for it, and then creating an instance of that contract using its address.\n\nAlso, remember to always validate user inputs and control the access to your functions in order to prevent unauthorized access.",
