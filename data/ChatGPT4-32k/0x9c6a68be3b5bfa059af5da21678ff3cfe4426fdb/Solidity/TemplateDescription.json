The selector is created using the `keccak256()` function, and the arguments to the function are passed in as additional parameters.\n- The `abi.decode()` function is used to convert the returned data to a `uint256`.\n- The contract does not do any arithmetic operations, so no overflow or underflow checks are performed.",
