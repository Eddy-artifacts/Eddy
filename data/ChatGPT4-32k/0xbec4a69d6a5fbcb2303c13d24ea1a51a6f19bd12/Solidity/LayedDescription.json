The SHA3 function is deprecated in Solidity and the keccak256 function should be used instead. The methods like \"transfer\", \"approveAndCall\", \"transferFrom\", and \"getAirdrop\" are common in ERC20 token contracts, but your logic appears to differ significantly from the typical implementation. Additionally, the logic you provided sometimes refers to changing the balance of an address, which is not possible directly - one can only change the balance of an address in a contract's mapping of balances. \n\nI recommend providing clear, step-by-step logic for each function, based on valid Solidity commands and common contract patterns.",
