It uses the `fallback` function to accept ether and `msg.value` to get the amount of ether sent. It then calculates the reward for the sender based on the previous withdrawal time and amount. It also updates the `showtotal` variable and transfers a portion of the received ether to two predefined owners.\n\n**Note:** This contract doesn't prevent reentrancy attacks and could be vulnerable. It's just an example to help you understand how you could implement the logic you described in Solidity. In real-world scenarios, I'd recommend using the OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard or similar patterns to prevent such attacks.",
