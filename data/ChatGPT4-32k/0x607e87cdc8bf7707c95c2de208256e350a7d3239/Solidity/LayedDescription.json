The contract also includes several functions that update the state variables based on certain conditions. The contract uses modifiers to restrict access to certain functions. For example, the `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can call certain functions, and the `whenNotPaused` and `whenPaused` modifiers check whether the contract is paused or not.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the contract, and you would need to replace the external function calls with the actual implementations, and also add the remaining functions based on the provided descriptions.",
