Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- When the indexofhodler of caller is not 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the balance of caller).\n  - When the lockeduntil of caller is smaller than (0x1e13380+current time), and the balance of caller is not greater than 0:\n    - the lockeduntil of caller will be updated to (0x1e13380+current time).\n    - the lockedfor of caller will be updated to 0x1e13380.\n- When the indexofhodler of caller is 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the balance of caller).\n  - the value caller will be put to the element in the hodlers.\n  - the indexofhodler of caller will be updated to the element in the hodlers.\n  - When the lockeduntil of caller is smaller than (0x1e13380+current time), and the balance of caller is not greater than 0:\n    - the lockeduntil of caller will be updated to (0x1e13380+current time).\n    - the lockedfor of caller will be updated to 0x1e13380.\n\nFor the reclaimToken function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the first argument with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: owner, and v0.\n\nFor the partyTo function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When the balance of the first argument is greater than 0:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the first argument to the first argument. Afterthat, \n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n  - When the indexofhodler of the first argument is greater than 0:\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - the balance of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n      - the lockeduntil of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n      - the lockedfor of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n      - the indexofhodler of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n      - the value (the element in the hodlers+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff) will be put to the element in the hodlers.\n      - the value 0 will be put to the element in the hodlers.\n      - the value 0 will be put to the element in the hodlers.\n      - the value 0 will be put to the element in the hodlers.\n      - the value 0 will be put to the element in the hodlers.\n      - the value 0 will be put to the element in the hodlers.\n      -

When the call or transfer fails, and the call or transfer fails, and for the first argument, and before the lockeduntil of the first argument:\n      - the balance of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n      - the lockeduntil of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n      - the lockedfor of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n      - the indexofhodler of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n      -
