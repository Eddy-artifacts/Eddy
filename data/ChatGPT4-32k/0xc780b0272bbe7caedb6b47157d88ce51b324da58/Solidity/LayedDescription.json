The `fallback` function checks if the contract balance is greater than the specified amount and if so, will transfer that amount to `depositaddress`. \n\nThe `setOwner` and `setDepositAddress` functions allow the `owner` to change the `owner` and `depositaddress` state variables, respectively. \n\nThe `withdraw` function allows the `owner` to withdraw a specified amount from the contract balance. \n\nFinally, the `ownerkill` function allows the `owner` to destroy the contract and send the remaining balance to the `owner`. In all these functions, the require statements ensure that only the `owner` can execute these functions and that the contract balance is sufficient for the transfers.",
