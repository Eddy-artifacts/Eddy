This `fallback()` function is made payable so it can receive Ether.\n\nInside the `fallback()` function, we use the `delegatecall` function which executes the callee's code in the context of the caller's state. `msg.data` is provided as input for the `delegatecall` which contains the complete calldata.\n\nIf the `delegatecall` fails for any reason, an exception is thrown, and all changes to the state are reverted. If it succeeds, all changes are kept.\n\nPlease make sure to replace the `targetAddress` with the actual contract address you want to delegate the call to.",
