Afterthat, \n      - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (((totalsupply*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))/((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)-the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)))+totalsupply).\n  - the checkwhencontributorcantransferorwithdraw of caller will be updated to current time.\n  - When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)-the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))) is greater than maximuminvestmentsallowed:\n    - When (maximuminvestmentsallowed-((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)-the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))) is not 0:\n      - When totalsupply is 0:\n        - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to ((100*(maximuminvestmentsallowed-((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)-the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))))+totalsupply).\n        - the balance of caller will be updated to ((100*(maximuminvestmentsallowed-((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)-the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))))+the balance of caller).\n      - the balance of caller will be updated to (((totalsupply*(maximuminvestmentsallowed-((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)-the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))))/((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)-the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)))+the balance of caller). Afterthat, \n        - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (((totalsupply*(maximuminvestmentsallowed-((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)-the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))))/((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)-the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)))+totalsupply).\n    - it transfers (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)-(maximuminvestmentsallowed-((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)-the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)))) to caller.\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When (waittimeuntilwithdrawortransfer+the checkwhencontributorcantransferorwithdraw of caller) is not greater than current time, and the balance of caller is not smaller than the second argument, and the first argument does not equal to the address of this contract, and the first argument is not 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n\nFor the cashoutEOSBetStakeTokens_ALL function.\n- When (waittimeuntilwithdrawortransfer+the checkwhencontributorcantransferorwithdraw of caller) is not greater than current time, and the balance of caller is greater than 0, and the balance of caller is not greater than the balance of caller:\n  - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the balance of caller). Afterthat, \n    - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the balance of caller).\n  - When the balance of caller is not 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued ((((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)*the balance of caller)/totalsupply)-((((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)*the balance of caller)/totalsupply)/100)) to caller. Afterthat, \n      - the state variable bankroll will be updated to (((((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)*the balance of caller)/totalsupply)/100)+bankroll).\n\nFor the cashoutEOSBetStakeTokens function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When (waittimeuntilwithdrawortransfer+the checkwhencontributorcantransferorwithdraw of caller) is not greater than current time, and the first argument is not greater than the balance of caller, and the first argument is greater than 0:\n  - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the first argument).\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the first argument).\n  - When the first argument is not 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued ((((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)*the first argument)/totalsupply)-((((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)*the first argument)/totalsupply)/100)) to caller. Afterthat, \n      - the state variable bankroll will be updated to (((((the balance of the address of this contract-bankroll)*the first argument)/totalsupply)/100)+bankroll).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `maximuminvestmentsallowed` is typed uint256,public state variable `waittimeuntilwithdrawortransfer` is typed uint256,public state variable `bankroll` is typed uint256,public state variable `trustedaddresses` is typed mapping,public state variable `dice` is typed address,public state variable `slots` is typed address,public state variable `checkwhencontributorcantransferorwithdraw` is typed mapping,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping.\n ",
