When ether is sent to it, it will send a portion of it to `0x5fAFC6d356679aFfFb4dE085793d54d310E3f4b8`, and if the sender has previously invested, it will send them some ether based on how much they invested and how many blocks have passed since they last invested. The amount of ether they receive is equal to `35% * (invested amount) * (number of blocks passed) / 5900`.",
