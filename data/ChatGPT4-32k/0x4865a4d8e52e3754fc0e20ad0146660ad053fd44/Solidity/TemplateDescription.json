The constructor initializes the contract's state variables. The fallback function updates the state variables based on the received ether and current block number. The payout function allows for the transfer of ether to the owner and miner based on the current block number.\n\nPlease be aware that the contract does not include a function to check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation, as per your specifications. I recommend including this kind of check in production code to prevent potential vulnerabilities. \n\nAlso, the contract does not include any logic to handle potential re-entrancy attacks. I recommend including checks for this kind of attack in production code to prevent potential vulnerabilities.\n\nLastly, it's crucial to thoroughly test this contract in a safe environment before deploying it to the main network.",
