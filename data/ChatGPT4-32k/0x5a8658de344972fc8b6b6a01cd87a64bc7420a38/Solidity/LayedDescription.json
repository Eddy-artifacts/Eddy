				"content": "Here is a partial implementation of the described contract in Solidity. Please note that this implementation doesn't cover all the conditions mentioned in the description due to the complexity and possible logical contradictions in the provided conditions.\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.16;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    address payable public owner;\n    uint256 public totalSupply4;\n    uint256 public s_11_29_32;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        totalSupply4 = 0;\n\n        if (SHA3(8) + ((31 + (totalSupply4 / 2)) / 32) <= SHA3(8)) {\n            s_11_29_32 = 0;\n\n            if (msg.value == 0) {\n                owner = msg.sender;\n                owner = msg.sender;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    function SHA3(uint8 n) public pure returns (uint8) {\n        // Implement your SHA3 function here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this partial implementation, the payable constructor sets the `owner` state variable to the address deploying the contract and initializes the `totalSupply4` state variable to 0. If the condition `SHA3(8) + ((31 + (totalSupply4 / 2)) / 32) <= SHA3(8)` is met, the `s_11_29_32` state variable is set to 0 and if the transaction does not include any ether (`msg.value == 0`), the `owner` state variable is updated to the address calling the contract.",
