The description provided is complex and appears to involve some form of nested conditions and recursive logic. It's not clear what the SHA3 calculations are supposed to represent, and it's not clear how the `totalSupply2`, `usersCanUnfreeze`, `usersCanTrade`, `totallockedrewards`, `lockedrewards`, `userrewarders`, `userrewardcount`, `userrewardercount`, `totalrewardissuedout` variables are meant to be used based on the provided description. The contract may need to be extended or modified to meet all the requirements.",
