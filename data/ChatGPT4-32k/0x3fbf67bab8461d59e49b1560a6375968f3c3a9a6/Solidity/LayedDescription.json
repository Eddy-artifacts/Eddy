It allows the contract owner to change the exchange rate, open or close crowdsale and candydrop. It also allows users to approve others to spend their tokens. The contract owner can mint new tokens, burn existing tokens, and transfer ownership of the contract. Please make sure to test this contract thoroughly before deploying it on the main network.",

Afterthat, \n    - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to multisigaddress.\n\nFor the burnTokens function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the balance of caller is greater than the first argument, and for owner:\n  - the state variable totalremainsupply will be updated to (totalremainsupply+the first argument).\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the first argument).\n\nFor the changeOwner function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the crowdsaleOpen function, it has one argument and its type is bool.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable crowdsaleisopen will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When (the balance of the first argument+the second argument) is greater than the balance of the first argument, and the balance of caller is not smaller than the second argument:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\nFor the setExchangeRate function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable exchangerate will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the approveAndCall function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, bytes.\n- the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n- When 0 is not smaller than the third argument:\n  - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n- When 0 is smaller than the third argument:\n  - When 32 is not smaller than the third argument:\n    - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n  - When 32 is smaller than the third argument:\n    - When 64 is not smaller than the third argument:\n      - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n    - When 64 is smaller than the third argument:\n      - When 96 is not smaller than the third argument:\n        - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n      - When 96 is smaller than the third argument:\n        - When 128 is not smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n        - When 160 is not smaller than the third argument, and 128 is smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n\nFor the mintTokens function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When (the balance of the first argument+the second argument) is greater than the balance of the first argument, and totalremainsupply is greater than the second argument, and for owner:\n  - the state variable totalremainsupply will be updated to (totalremainsupply-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalremainsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `exchangerate` is typed uint256,public state variable `candyrate` is typed uint256,public state variable `candydropisopen` is typed bool,public state variable `crowdsaleisopen` is typed bool,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `blacklist` is typed mapping,public state variable `multisigaddress` is typed address.\n ",
