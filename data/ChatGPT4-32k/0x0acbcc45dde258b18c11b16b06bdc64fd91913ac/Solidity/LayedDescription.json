When the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - the state variable totalSupply2 will be updated to totalSupply2.\n  - When the balance of caller is 0:\n    - the state variable countmembers will be updated to (1+countmembers).\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to 1.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `totalSupply2` is typed uint256,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `newowner` is typed address,private state variable `balanceOf` is typed mapping,public state variable `token` is typed address,public state variable `currentstate` is typed uint8,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalfunds` is typed uint256,public state variable `currentprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `beneficiary` is typed address,public state variable `countmembers` is typed uint256.\n ",
