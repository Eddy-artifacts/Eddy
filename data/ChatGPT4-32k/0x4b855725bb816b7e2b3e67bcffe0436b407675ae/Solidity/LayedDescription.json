This ensures that only the owner can change the owner, withdraw ether from the contract, set the resolver, and set the fee. The `setOwner` function updates the `owner` state variable, `withdraw` transfers all ether from the contract to the owner, `setResolver` updates the `resolver` state variable, and `setFee` updates the `fee` state variable. Please make sure to adapt it to your needs and test it thoroughly before deploying.",
