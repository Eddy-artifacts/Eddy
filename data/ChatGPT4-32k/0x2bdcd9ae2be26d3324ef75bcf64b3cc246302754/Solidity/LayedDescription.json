Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the burn function.\n- For owner, and halted is not 0:\n  - the contract will be destroyed and its balance will be sent to owner.\n\nFor the halt function.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable halted will be updated to 1.\n\nFor the withdraw function.\n- When softcapreached is not 0, and for owner:\n  - it transfers ether valued collected to beneficiary.\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0. Afterthat, \n    - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract token with the following argument list: beneficiary, and v0.\n    - the state variable crowdsalefinished will be updated to 1.\n\nFor the start function, it has 4 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256.\n- For owner, and starttime is not greater than 0:\n  - the state variable hardcap will be updated to (the first argument*0xde0b6b3a7640000).\n  - the state variable softcap will be updated to (the second argument*0xde0b6b3a7640000).\n  - the state variable price will be updated to the fourth argument.\n  - the state variable starttime will be updated to current time. Afterthat, \n    - the state variable endtime will be updated to (starttime+(the third argument*3600)).\n  - the state variable duration will be updated to the third argument.\n\nFor the extend function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable endtime will be updated to (endtime+(the first argument*3600)).\n  - the state variable duration will be updated to (duration+the first argument).\n\nFor the unhalt function.\n- For owner, and halted is not 0:\n  - the state variable halted will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the finish function.\n- After endtime, and for owner:\n  - the state variable crowdsalefinished will be updated to 1.\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner, and the first argument does not equal to 0:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the refund function.\n- When softcapreached is 0, and crowdsalefinished is not 0, and the balance of caller is 0, and halted is 0, and after endtime:\n  -
