It also includes functions for setting the `mintarget` state variable (only callable by the owner of the contract), setting a user-specific target (only callable if the user has a positive balance and the new target isn't lower than `mintarget`), and withdrawing money from the contract (only callable if the user has a sufficient balance, the withdrawal amount is positive, and the user's balance isn't lower than their target).",
