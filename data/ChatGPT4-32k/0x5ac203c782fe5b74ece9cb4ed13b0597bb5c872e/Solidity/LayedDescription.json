Each function checks for the required conditions before executing. Note that I assumed `tokenreward` is an ERC20 token, so I created a simple interface `IERC20` to interact with it.\n\nPlease replace the `IERC20` interface with the actual interface or ABI of your token. Also, you may need to modify the contract to fit your exact requirements, this is a basic implementation based on the information you provided.",
