The contract assumes that the token contract complies with the ERC20 standard. The contract contains a modifier, `onlyOwner`, which restricts function access to only the contract's owner. The `setRate`, `withdrawETH` and `transferAnyERC20Token` functions are restricted to only the contract's owner. The `receive` function is a payable fallback function that performs token transfers according to the logic described. The `TokenLinked` function queries the token balance of the contract.",
