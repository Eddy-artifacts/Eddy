The fallback function accepts Ether and transfers tokens from the `tokenreward` contract to the sender. The `destroy` function destroys the contract and sends its balance to the owner. The `withdraw` function allows the owner to withdraw a specified amount of Ether. The `withdrawTokens` function allows the owner to withdraw a specified amount of tokens from a specified token contract. The `changeEtherPrice` function allows the owner to change the Ether price. The `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer the contract ownership to another address.",
