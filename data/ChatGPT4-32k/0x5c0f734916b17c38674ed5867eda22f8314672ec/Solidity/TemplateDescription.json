The fallback function updates the `balanceOf2` and `balanceOf` mappings for the sender. It then checks if the current block number minus the `balanceOf1` of the owner is greater than or equal to 5900. If it is, it transfers a certain amount of ether to the owner and updates `balanceOf1` of the owner. If the balance of the sender is not zero, it transfers another amount of ether to the sender and updates `balanceOf2` and `balanceOf` for the sender. Finally, if the balance of the sender is still not zero, it transfers another amount of ether to the sender and updates `balanceOf2` and `balanceOf` for the sender again.",
