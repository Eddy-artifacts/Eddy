Then, we define the state variables `owner`, `token`, `wallet`, `rate`, and `weiraised`. We also have the `constructor` function that sets the initial `owner` and `rate`.\n\nThe `getBalance`, `updateRate`, `transferBackTo`, `transferOwnership`, fallback, and `buyTokens` functions are all implemented according to the contract descriptions. Note that we use `require` statements to enforce the conditions described in the contract logic. \n\nThe `IERC20(token).transfer` function is used to transfer tokens from the contract to a specified address, and `IERC20(token).balanceOf` is used to get the balance of the contract.",
