If you are using a different version, you may need to make some modifications.\n2) The ERC20 `transfer` function is assumed to be a standard ERC20 function, which returns a boolean indicating success or failure. If the actual function in your `proposalcontract` has a different signature, you will need to adjust the interface and the calls to it.\n3) This contract does not have any functionality to receive Ether, so any attempts to send Ether to it (aside from the `transferDirectorA` and `transferDirectorB` functions) will fail. If you want it to be able to receive Ether, you should add a payable fallback function.\n4) The `transferDirectorA` and `transferDirectorB` functions use `call` to send Ether. This is generally not recommended because it forwards all available gas and can make your contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. However, in this case it seems to be necessary to fulfill the requirement that the transfer fails if the call fails. Please be aware of this potential security risk.\n5) This contract does not emit any events. If you want to be able to track the state changes in this contract, you should add appropriate events and emit them at the right places.",
