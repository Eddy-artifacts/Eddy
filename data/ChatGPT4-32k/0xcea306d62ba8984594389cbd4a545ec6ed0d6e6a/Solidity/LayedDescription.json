This interface assumes that the `tokenreward` contract has the functions `decimals`, `balanceOf`, `setAllowanceBeforeWithdrawal`, `adminAddr`, and `transferFrom`. If the actual `tokenreward` contract does not have these functions or has them with different parameters or return values, you will need to adjust the `TokenReward` interface accordingly.",
