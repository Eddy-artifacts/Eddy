Solidity is a complex language and there are many things to consider when writing a secure smart contract. This includes handling function visibility, reentrancy attacks, underflows/overflows, etc. The functions for changing various parameters (like `changeFeeMake`) should only be callable by the admin, and so on. Also note that Solidity doesn't have a built-in `transferFrom` or `transfer` function, these are part of the ERC20 token standard. You would need to import a token contract to interact with these functions.",
