				"content": "Given the complex nature of the provided description, here's a simplified version of the contract logic that covers some of the requirements:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.6.12;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    address payable public owner;\n    uint256 public totalSupply4;\n    uint256 public s_11_29_32;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        totalSupply4 = 0;\n\n        if (sha3(8) + ((31 + (totalSupply4 / 2)) / 32) <= sha3(8)) {\n            s_11_29_32 = 0;\n\n            if (msg.value == 0) {\n                owner = msg.sender;\n                owner = msg.sender;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (msg.value == 0) {\n            totalSupply4 = 0;\n\n            if (sha3(8) + ((31 + (totalSupply4 / 2)) / 32) > sha3(8)) {\n                if (sha3(8) + ((31 + (totalSupply4 / 2)) / 32) <= 1 + sha3(8)) {\n                    owner = msg.sender;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (sha3(8) + ((31 + (totalSupply4 / 2)) / 32) > sha3(8)) {\n            s_11_29_32 = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function sha3(uint256 num) private pure returns (uint256) {\n        return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(num)));\n    }\n}\n```\nThis contract uses a payable constructor function to set the contract's `owner` to the address that deployed the contract. The `totalSupply4` is set to 0 when the contract is deployed. The `s_11_29_32` variable is updated based on the result of the SHA3 hash function. If the ether received (`msg.value`) is 0, then the `owner` is updated to the caller of the function. The contract also includes a private `sha3` function which takes a `uint256` input and returns the keccak256 hash of the input.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version and does not cover all the requirements from the provided description due to its complexity.\n\nAlso, the SHA-3 (Keccak) hashing function is used in the code above because it is native in Solidity while SHA-256 is not. If you want to use SHA-256, you will need to include the `sha256` function from the `crypto` library.",
