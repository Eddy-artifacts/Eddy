The fallback function accepts ether and updates the balance of the sender and the total amount raised. If a price is set, it also calls the `transfer` function of the `tokenreward` contract.\n\nThe `checkGoalReached` function can be called to check if the funding goal has been reached after the deadline. If the goal has been reached, `paused1` is set to true.\n\nThe `safeWithdrawal` function allows users to withdraw their balance after the deadline. If the funding goal was not reached, users can withdraw their balance. If the goal was reached, the beneficiary can withdraw the total amount raised.",
