The `fallback` function is payable and external which means it is called when a contract is called with no data and there is no other function to call, and it can receive Ether. It's also important to check if the contracts that you are interacting with (i.e., `pricingstrategyaddress` and `tokenaddress`) have the functions `calculatePrice` and `transfer` respectively.",
