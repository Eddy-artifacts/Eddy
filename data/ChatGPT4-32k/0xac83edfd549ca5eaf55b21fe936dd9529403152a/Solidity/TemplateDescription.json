The `withdrawFunds` function allows the `owner` to withdraw a specified amount of ether from the contract or all the ether if the specified amount is 0. The `withdrawAllFunds` function allows the `owner` to withdraw all ether from the contract. In both functions, ether is transferred using the `call` function, and the functions check that the transfer was successful.",
