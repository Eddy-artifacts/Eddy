The `withdrawFunds` function allows the owner to withdraw a specific amount of ether from the contract, or the entire balance if the provided amount is 0. The `withdrawAllFunds` function allows the owner to withdraw all funds from the contract. Both functions have appropriate checks for the owner and sufficient funds in the contract.",
