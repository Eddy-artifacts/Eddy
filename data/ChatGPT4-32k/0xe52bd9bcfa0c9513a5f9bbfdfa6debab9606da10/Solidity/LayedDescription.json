It updates `balanceOf` and `balanceOf1` for the sender of the transaction (`msg.sender`) with the current block number and the amount of Ether received (`msg.value`), respectively.\n\nThe `withdraw` function first calculates the amount to be withdrawn as specified in the contract description. It then checks that the withdrawal amount is not greater than the contract's balance, that the withdrawal amount is greater than 0, and that the difference between the current block number and the sender's balance is not greater than 100. If these conditions are met, it transfers the withdrawal amount to the sender and updates `balanceOf1` for the sender to 0.",
