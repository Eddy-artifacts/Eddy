Also, there's no built-in `transferFrom` function for the address type. You'll need to use an ERC20 token contract address instead of a normal address to call the `transferFrom` function. The above contract is a simplified version and doesn't check for the caller to be admin before modifying the state variables. You might want to add `require(msg.sender == admin)` in those functions for security reasons.",
