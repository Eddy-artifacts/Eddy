Please note that the Etherwow contract's address should implement a `userRollDice` function that accepts two arguments: a uint256 and an address, and is payable. \n\nThe fallback function will only call `userRollDice` if the contract receives exactly 0x6f05b59d3b20000 wei and the `bet` state variable is set to true.\n\nThe `ownerSetMod` and `ownerSetEtherwowAddress` functions can only be called by the owner of the contract. The `require` statements at the beginning of these functions ensure this.",
