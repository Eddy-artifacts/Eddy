You would need to replace it with the actual function you need to call from the third-party contract. Also, the contract does not differentiate between \"cloversController\", \"clubTokenController\", \"owner\", and \"users\", as not enough information was given in the description for how to differentiate these roles. Typically, you would have different modifier functions similar to \"onlyOwner\" to restrict access to certain functions.",
