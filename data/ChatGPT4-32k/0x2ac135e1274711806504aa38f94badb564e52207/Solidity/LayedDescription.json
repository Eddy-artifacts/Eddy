It's important to note that this function can only be executed if the contract has at least 2 Ether. This function sends 1 Ether twice to the address provided as an argument. The `receive` function is a fallback function that allows the contract to receive Ether.\n\nPlease note that this contract does not include any error handling for the case when the transfer function fails. Depending on your needs, you might want to add some `try/catch` blocks or a `revert` statement.",
