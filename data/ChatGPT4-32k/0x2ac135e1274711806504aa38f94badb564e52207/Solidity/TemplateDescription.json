The function `checkBalanceSendEth` is declared `payable` and takes a `payable` address as an argument. This function sends 1 ether twice to the given address. It uses `.call()` instead of `.send()` or `.transfer()` to send the ether. There are checks to ensure that the receiver is not the zero address and that the contract has enough balance to send the ether. There is also error handling to ensure that the ether was successfully sent.",
