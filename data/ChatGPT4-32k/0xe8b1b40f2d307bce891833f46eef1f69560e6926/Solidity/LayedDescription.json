it transfers ether valued the fundbalance of caller to caller.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - the fundbalance of caller will be updated to 0.\n  - For beneficiary, and fundinggoalreached is not 0, and the balance of the address of this contract is greater than 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to caller.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - the state variable peramountraised will be updated to 0.\n- When amountraised is not smaller than maxgoal, and before freecrawdeadline:\n  - For users, except for beneficiary, and the fundbalance of caller is greater than 0, and fundinggoalreached is 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued the fundbalance of caller to caller.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - the fundbalance of caller will be updated to 0.\n  - When fundinggoalreached is not 0, and for beneficiary, and the balance of the address of this contract is greater than 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to caller.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - the state variable peramountraised will be updated to 0.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `newowner` is typed address,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `tokenowner` is typed address,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `frozenaccountbyowner` is typed mapping,public state variable `freecrawdeadline` is typed uint256,public state variable `beneficiary` is typed address,public state variable `mingoal` is typed uint256,public state variable `maxgoal` is typed uint256,public state variable `price` is typed uint256,public state variable `perprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `perdeadline` is typed uint256,public state variable `peramountraised` is typed uint256,public state variable `pertokenamount` is typed uint256,public state variable `pertokenamountmax` is typed uint256,public state variable `crowdsaleclosed` is typed bool,public state variable `fundinggoalreached` is typed bool,public state variable `totalraised` is typed uint256,public state variable `amountraised` is typed uint256,public state variable `tokenamountrasied` is typed uint256,public state variable `bonus01` is typed uint256,public state variable `bonus01start` is typed uint256,public state variable `bonus01end` is typed uint256,public state variable `bonus02` is typed uint256,public state variable `bonus02start` is typed uint256,public state variable `bonus02end` is typed uint256,public state variable `bonus` is typed uint256,public state variable `fundbalance` is typed mapping.\n ",
