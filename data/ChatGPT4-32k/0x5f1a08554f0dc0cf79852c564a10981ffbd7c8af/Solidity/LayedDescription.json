There are two functions: `approveOracle` and `revokeOracle`, which only the contract owner can call to set the balance of a specific address to 1 and 0 respectively. The `setStatus` function also can only be called by the owner and it updates the status to the input argument if it is not greater than 3 and if the current status is not greater than 3.",
