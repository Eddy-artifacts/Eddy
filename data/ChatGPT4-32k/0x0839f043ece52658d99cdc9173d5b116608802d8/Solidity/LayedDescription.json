When 0 is not greater than the second argument, and the second argument is 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued (the second argument-0) to tokenholder.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - it transfers ether valued 0 to cryptofloat.\n  - When ((1000*the second argument)/(licenceamountscaled+1000)) is not greater than the second argument, and the second argument is not 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued (the second argument-((1000*the second argument)/(licenceamountscaled+1000))) to tokenholder.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - it transfers ether valued ((1000*the second argument)/(licenceamountscaled+1000)) to cryptofloat.\n- When tkncontractaddress equals to the first argument:\n  - it calls an external function transferFrom of the first argument with the following argument list: 28 V77@0xeac@0xe9d 4, 28 V80@0xeb3@0xe9d 4, and 28 V42@0x1bc@0x1ab 4 and 0xffffffff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 or 0.\n\nFor the updateLicenceDAO function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- it statically calls an external function resolver of the external contract token with controllernode as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n- When the call or transfer succeeds:\n  - it statically calls an external function addr of v1 with controllernode as the argument.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it statically calls an external function isAdmin of v0 with caller as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n    - When licencedaolocked is 0, and v0 is not 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - the state variable licencedao will be updated to the first argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `token` is typed address,public state variable `ensregistry` is typed address,public state variable `controllernode` is typed uint256,public state variable `tkncontractaddress` is typed address,public state variable `cryptofloat` is typed address,public state variable `tokenholder` is typed address,public state variable `tkncontractaddresslocked` is typed bool,public state variable `licencedaolocked` is typed bool,public state variable `holderlocked` is typed bool,public state variable `floatlocked` is typed bool,public state variable `licencedao` is typed address,public state variable `licenceamountscaled` is typed uint256.\n ",
