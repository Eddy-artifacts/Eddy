The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the owner can call certain functions. The `renounceOwnership` and `transferOwnership` functions allow the owner to renounce ownership or transfer it to a new owner. The `upgrade`, `changeProxyAdmin`, `getProxyImplementation`, and `getProxyAdmin` functions interact with a proxy contract. The `upgradeAndCall` function is payable, allows the contract owner to upgrade a proxy contract and then call a function in the new contract, and it accepts ether that is sent to the contract.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic implementation and may need further adjustments based on your specific requirements, especially around error handling and security measures.",
