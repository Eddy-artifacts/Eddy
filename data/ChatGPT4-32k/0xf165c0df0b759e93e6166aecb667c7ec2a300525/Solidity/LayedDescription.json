It also defines an `approve` function for setting allowances, and a `withdrawEtherHomeLocal` function that allows the owner to withdraw all Ether from the contract.\n\nDue to character limitations, not all functions are included in this example. Other functions would follow a similar structure, updating state variables and performing actions based on the conditions described in the question.",
