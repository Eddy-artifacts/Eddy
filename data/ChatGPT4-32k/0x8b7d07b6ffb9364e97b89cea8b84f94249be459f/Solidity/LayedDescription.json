There are also methods to change the `foundation`, `dev`, and `owner` addresses. The contract accepts Ether via its fallback function and updates the balance of the sender. \n\nPlease note, the `changeFoundation`, `changeDev`, and `changeOwner` functions are only callable by the `owner` of the contract. \n\nPlease consult with a professional solidity developer to develop a contract that fully fits your needs and has been properly tested and audited for security considerations.",
