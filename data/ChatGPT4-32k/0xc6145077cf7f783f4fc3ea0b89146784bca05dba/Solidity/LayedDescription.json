Sets the owner of the contract to the address that deploys it (in the constructor).\n2. Provides a function `withdraw` that allows the owner to withdraw all Ether from the contract. The `require` statement ensures only the owner can call this function. The `payable(owner).transfer` line is what actually sends the Ether.",
