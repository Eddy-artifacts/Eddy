It's assumed that the token contract at the `token` address implements ERC20 standard. Also, the `delegatecall` to `balanceOf` method of the token contract is used to update the `totalremaining` variable, which might not be the intended behavior. The `delegatecall` method is used to execute code in the context of the calling contract, so it might lead to unpredictable results if not used carefully.",
