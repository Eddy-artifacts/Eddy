When ((((the balance of the address of this contract+contracttotalmined)*the usersntd of caller)/totalntd)-the userswithdrew of caller) is greater than 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued ((((the balance of the address of this contract+contracttotalmined)*the usersntd of caller)/totalntd)-the userswithdrew of caller) to caller.\n\nFor the Cashing function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When ((((the balance of the address of this contract+contracttotalmined)*the usersntd of caller)/totalntd)-the userswithdrew of caller) is 0, and ((((the balance of the address of this contract+contracttotalmined)*the usersntd of the first argument)/totalntd)-the userswithdrew of the first argument) is 0, and the current block's number is greater than closeblock, and the usersntd of caller is not 0, and the second argument is not greater than 1000, and totalntd is not 0, and the second argument is greater than 0:\n  - the usersntd of the first argument will be updated to (((the second argument*the usersntd of caller)/1000)+the usersntd of the first argument). Afterthat, \n    - the usersntd of caller will be updated to (the usersntd of caller-((the second argument*the usersntd of caller)/1000)).\n  - the userswithdrew of the first argument will be updated to (((the second argument*the userswithdrew of caller)/1000)+the userswithdrew of the first argument). Afterthat, \n    - the userswithdrew of caller will be updated to (the userswithdrew of caller-((the second argument*the userswithdrew of caller)/1000)).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `warning` is typed string,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `closeblock` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalntd` is typed uint256,public state variable `contracttotalmined` is typed uint256,public state variable `usersntd` is typed mapping,public state variable `userswithdrew` is typed mapping.\n ",
