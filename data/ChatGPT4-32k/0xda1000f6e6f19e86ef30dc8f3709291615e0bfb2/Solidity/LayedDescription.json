The Solidity compiler needs to know at all times what the type of each variable is. This means that we cannot perform operations between different types of variables, like adding a `uint` and a `string` together. In the contract you described, the operations between variables are not always possible due to type differences. Please double-check the logic and the operation between the variables.",
