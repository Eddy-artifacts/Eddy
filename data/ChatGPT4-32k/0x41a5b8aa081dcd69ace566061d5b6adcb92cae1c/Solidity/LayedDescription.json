				"content": "Sure, here is a simplified version of the contract. Please note that this contract is not functional and does not include all error checking and security measures you would need in a production contract. It is just to illustrate how you might structure the contract based on your description:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;\n\ncontract SampleContract {\n    address public owner;\n    address public feeAccount;\n    mapping(address => bool) public admins;\n    mapping(address => bool) public approvedCurrencyTokens;\n    mapping(address => uint) public lastActiveTransaction;\n    mapping(address => uint) public invalidOrder;\n    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) public balanceOf;\n    uint256 public makerFee;\n    uint256 public takerFee;\n    uint256 public inactivityReleasePeriod;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        feeAccount = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    modifier onlyOwner {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        _;\n    }\n\n    modifier onlyAdmin {\n        require(admins[msg.sender]);\n        _;\n    }\n\n    function setAdmin(address admin, bool isAdmin) onlyOwner public {\n        admins[admin] = isAdmin;\n    }\n\n    function approveCurrencyTokenAddress(address currencyToken, bool isApproved) public {\n        if (msg.sender != owner) {\n            require(admins[msg.sender]);\n        }\n        approvedCurrencyTokens[currencyToken] = isApproved;\n    }\n\n    function depositToken(address token, uint amount) public {\n        // TODO: Call transferFrom here\n        balanceOf[msg.sender][token] += amount;\n        lastActiveTransaction[msg.sender] = block.number;\n    }\n\n    // Other functions go here...\n}\n```\n\nThis contract includes the `approvedCurrencyTokens` mapping and the `approveCurrencyTokenAddress` function, which can be used by the contract owner or an admin to approve a token. It also includes the `depositToken` function, which updates the user's balance and sets their last active transaction to the current block number.\n\nThe `onlyOwner` and `onlyAdmin` modifiers are used to restrict access to certain functions. The `setAdmin` function can be used by the contract owner to designate other addresses as admins.\n\nThis contract does not include all the functionality you described, but it should give you a good starting point. You would need to add the remaining functions and state variables, and implement the detailed logic as described.",
