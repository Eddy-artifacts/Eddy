the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n  - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When (the balance of the first argument+the second argument) is not smaller than the balance of the first argument, and the balance of caller is not smaller than the second argument:\n  - When the first argument does not equal to the address of this contract:\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n  - When the first argument equals to the address of this contract:\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n    - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the second argument).\n    - When totalsupply equals to 0:\n      - the state variable redeemprice will be updated to 0.\n      - the state variable tokenprice will be updated to 0x5f5e100.\n    - When lasttxblocknum is not smaller than (the current block's number-5000):\n      - it transfers ether valued ((the second argument*redeemprice)/0x3b9aca00) to caller.\n      - When totalsupply is not 0, and totalsupply does not equal to 0:\n        - the state variable tokenprice will be updated to (((((the balance of the address of this contract-((the second argument*redeemprice)/0x3b9aca00))*0x3b9aca00)/totalsupply)*1100)/1000). Afterthat, \n          - the state variable redeemprice will be updated to (((((the balance of the address of this contract-((the second argument*redeemprice)/0x3b9aca00))*0x3b9aca00)/totalsupply)*900)/1000).\n    - When lasttxblocknum is smaller than (the current block's number-5000):\n      - it transfers ether valued ((the second argument*((the balance of the address of this contract*0x3b9aca00)/totalsupply))/0x3b9aca00) to caller.\n      - When totalsupply is not 0, and totalsupply does not equal to 0:\n        - the state variable redeemprice will be updated to (((((the balance of the address of this contract-((the second argument*((the balance of the address of this contract*0x3b9aca00)/totalsupply))/0x3b9aca00))*0x3b9aca00)/totalsupply)*900)/1000).\n        - the state variable tokenprice will be updated to (((((the balance of the address of this contract-((the second argument*((the balance of the address of this contract*0x3b9aca00)/totalsupply))/0x3b9aca00))*0x3b9aca00)/totalsupply)*1100)/1000).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `standard` is typed string,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `tokenprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `redeemprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `lasttxblocknum` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping.\n ",
