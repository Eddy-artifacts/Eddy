The `require` keyword is used to ensure that the conditions described in the problem are met before executing the rest of the function. The `+=` and `-=` operators are used to perform safe addition and subtraction, respectively, in order to avoid overflow and underflow errors. The `transfer` function is used to send ether to an address, and the `call` function is used to call an external function with ether value.",
