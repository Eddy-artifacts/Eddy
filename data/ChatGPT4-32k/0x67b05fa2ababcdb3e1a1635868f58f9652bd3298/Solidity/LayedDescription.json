The conditions under which you're updating the `last_completed_migration` state variable are very intricate and seem to be recursively nested. It's recommended to simplify your contract logic.\n\nAlso, I've assumed that the `SHA3(0)` is the keccak256 hash of zero. In solidity, `SHA3` is actually `keccak256`.",
