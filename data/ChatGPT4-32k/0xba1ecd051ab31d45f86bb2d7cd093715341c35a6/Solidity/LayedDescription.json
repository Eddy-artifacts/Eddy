It also includes a constructor for initializing the `owner` of the contract.\n\nNote: The `determineWinner` function uses the `blockhash` and `coinbase` values for generating a pseudo-random index. This method is not truly random and may be predictable by miners. For a more secure random number generation, you should consider using an off-chain oracle or a commit-reveal scheme.",
