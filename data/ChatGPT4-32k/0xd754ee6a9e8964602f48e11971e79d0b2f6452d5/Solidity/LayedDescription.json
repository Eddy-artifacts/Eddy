The `ownerSetMod` function allows the contract owner to change the `bet` state variable, and the `ownerSetEtherwowAddress` function changes the `etherwow` contract address.  \n\nPlease note that this contract assumes that the `etherwow` contract has a `userRollDice` function that takes a `uint256` and an `address` as arguments. If this is not the case, the contract will not work as expected. Please also note that the `etherwow` contract address must be set by the contract owner before the fallback function can be used.",
