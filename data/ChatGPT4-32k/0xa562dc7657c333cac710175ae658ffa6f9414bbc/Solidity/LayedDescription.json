It includes a constructor that sets the initial supply and token price, a transfer function that moves tokens from the sender's account to a specified address, an approve function that allows a certain account to spend a specific amount of tokens on behalf of the sender, and a transferFrom function that moves tokens from one account to another, provided the transaction has been approved. Furthermore, it includes a function to end the ICO by transferring all remaining tokens to the owner, a function to burn tokens by removing them from the supply, and a fallback function that allows anyone to buy tokens by sending ether to the contract. The function BuyTokens allows the purchase of tokens.",
