				"content": "Here is a simplified Solidity contract that captures some of the provided logic. Due to the complexity of the provided description, it is not realistic to cover all of the described functionality in a single sample contract, but the following example should provide a good starting point:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.7.0;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    string public name;\n    string public symbol;\n    uint256 public totalsupply;\n    address public owner;\n    uint8 public decimals;\n    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceof;\n    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowance;\n    uint256 public starttime;\n    uint256 public endtime;\n    uint256 public price;\n    uint256 public weiraised;\n    bool public paused;\n    uint256 private totalSupply2;\n    uint256 public cap;\n    \n    constructor() public payable {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        totalsupply = 0x2faf080;\n        decimals = 0;\n        starttime = 0x5a3eee00;\n        endtime = 0x5ac020ff;\n        price = 0x1ce33d770fc64;\n        paused = false;\n        cap = 0xd3c21bcecceda1000000;\n        balanceof[owner] = totalsupply;\n    }\n    \n    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(!paused);\n        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n    \n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(!paused);\n        require(_to != address(0));\n        balanceof[_from] -= _value;\n        balanceof[_to] += _value;\n        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n    \n    function decreaseApproval(address _spender, uint256 _subtractedValue) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(!paused);\n        uint256 oldValue = allowance[msg.sender][_spender];\n        if (_subtractedValue >= oldValue) {\n            allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = 0;\n        } else {\n            allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = oldValue - _subtractedValue;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    \n    function changeCap(uint256 _newCap) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        require(_newCap > 0);\n        cap = _newCap;\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this contract, the `constructor` function is a payable function, which means it can receive ether when the contract is created. The `approve` function allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account, up to the `_value` amount. The `transferFrom` function is used to move `_value` tokens from `_from` account to `_to` account. The `decreaseApproval` function decreases the allowance and the `changeCap` function changes the cap value. The contract also includes a few state variables and mappings.\n\nPlease note that this contract is a simplified representation and may not fully satisfy all of your requirements. You might need to write additional functions and add more conditions to handle all the edge cases as described in your narrative. This contract is also not tested, so please do not use it in production without proper testing.",
