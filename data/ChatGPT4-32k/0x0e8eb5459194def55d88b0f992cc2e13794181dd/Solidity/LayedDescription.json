This function then delegates the call to the address `0x059FFAFdC6eF594230dE44F824E2bD0A51CA5dED` with all arguments and data sent with the original call.\n\nPlease note that delegatecall is a low-level function and can be risky to use, because it executes code in the context of the calling contract, changing its state variables. Therefore, it is usually recommended to avoid using delegatecall unless you are very sure about what you're doing.",
