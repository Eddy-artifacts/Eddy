				"content": "Here is a simple contract that fulfills your requirements. Please note that this contract is quite basic and does not include all of your specifications as some of them are not applicable to this simple contract.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract Forwarder {\n    // The target address is hardcoded\n    address payable private constant target = 0x059FFAFdC6eF594230dE44F824E2bD0A51CA5dED;\n\n    // This function is called whenever the contract receives plain Ether (without data)\n    fallback() external payable {\n        // Check if the target address is not zero\n        require(target != address(0), \"Target address is zero\");\n\n        // Forward the funds and data to the target address\n        (bool success, bytes memory data) = target.delegatecall(msg.data);\n        \n        // Check whether the call was successful\n        require(success, \"Call was not successful\");\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this contract, the `fallback` function is used to forward any Ether and data sent to the contract to the target address using a `delegatecall`. The `delegatecall` function performs a low-level call with the same context as the calling function, meaning that the `msg.sender` and `msg.value` in the called function will be the same as in the calling function. The `delegatecall` function returns a boolean indicating whether the call was successful and any data returned by the called function. If the call was not successful, the contract reverts with an error message. Note that the target address is a `payable` address, allowing it to receive Ether.",
