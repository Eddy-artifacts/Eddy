The purchase function is public and can be called by anyone, and it calls an external function on another contract, passing in the caller address, the first argument, and the contract address. It also checks that the contract has enough money to cover the cost and that the caller sent enough ether to cover the cost. If either of these checks fail, the function call will revert and no changes will be made.",
