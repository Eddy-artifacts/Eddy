the owner of the third argument will be updated to (the owner of the third argument-(the second argument+0x6a94d74f430000)).\n        - When (0x6a94d74f430000+the owner of feeaccount) is not smaller than the owner of feeaccount:\n          - the owner of feeaccount will be updated to (0x6a94d74f430000+the owner of feeaccount).\n          - it transfers ether valued the second argument to the third argument.\n          - When the call or transfer fails:\n            - the lastactivetransaction of the third argument will be updated to the current block's number.\n\nFor the withdraw function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not greater than the balance from the first argument to caller, and the lastactivetransaction of caller is not greater than the current block's number, and (the current block's number-the lastactivetransaction of caller) is not smaller than inactivityreleaseperiod:\n  - the balance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the balance from the first argument to caller-the second argument).\n  - When the first argument is 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued the second argument to caller.\n  - When the first argument is not 0:\n    - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and the second argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `addressOfBountyMembers` is typed array,public state variable `owner` is typed uint160,public state variable `feeaccount` is typed address,public state variable `makerfee` is typed uint256,public state variable `takerfee` is typed uint256,public state variable `inactivityreleaseperiod` is typed uint256,public state variable `approvedcurrencytokens` is typed mapping,public state variable `invalidorder` is typed mapping,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `admins` is typed mapping,public state variable `lastactivetransaction` is typed mapping,public state variable `orderfills` is typed mapping,public state variable `withdrawn` is typed mapping.\n ",
