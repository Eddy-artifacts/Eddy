The `withdraw` function requires that the `validator` is the zero address, the length of `_data` is not 65, and the user's used amount is less than `_amount`. It then makes a call to an external function on the user's contract, passing in `_data` and sending ether calculated based on `_amount` and `tiptoether`. If this call is successful, it updates the user's used amount.",
