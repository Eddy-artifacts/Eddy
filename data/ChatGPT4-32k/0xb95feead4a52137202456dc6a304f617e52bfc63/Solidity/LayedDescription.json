It also keeps track of balances of all addresses, and a mapping of index to address for 'wereld'. It provides functions to withdraw balance, set the rowquiter status and to buy a block. For the buyBlock function, it adheres to the complex logic provided in the description. The logic has been simplified to improve readability and efficiency. The function also checks if the caller has enough balance to process the request.",
