Some parts of your description are a bit unclear (for example, what exactly `SHA3(SHA3(caller,4))+((31+(the balance1 of caller/2))/32))` is calculating and how it's being used), so you may need to adjust the code to fit your exact requirements. The `SHA3` function does not exist in Solidity, so I used `keccak256` which is the equivalent in this language. Also, the `changeColorGreen` function does not fully implement the nested if conditions as described because the description is unclear about what exactly needs to be done in each if block. You'd need to replace those parts with your own logic.",
