The `setEmergencyCode` function allows the `owner` to set the `totalSupply` and `rate`. The `withdraw` function allows the `owner` to withdraw ether as long as the amount does not exceed the contract's balance. The `useEmergencyCode` function allows a caller to become `owner2` if they send an amount of ether equal to `rate` and provide a correct emergency code that matches `totalSupply`.",
