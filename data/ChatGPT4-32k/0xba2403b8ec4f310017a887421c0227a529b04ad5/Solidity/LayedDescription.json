This function updates the balance of the sender with the ether it receives. \n\nThe contract also includes a payable function called 'party'. This function checks if the current time is past a certain timestamp (0x5f220d80) and if the balance of the sender is greater than 0. If both conditions are met, it transfers the balance of the sender back to the sender and updates the balance of the sender to 0. \n\nPlease note that this contract does not include any function to withdraw the funds in case the party function is not called. This could result in the funds being stuck in the contract.",
