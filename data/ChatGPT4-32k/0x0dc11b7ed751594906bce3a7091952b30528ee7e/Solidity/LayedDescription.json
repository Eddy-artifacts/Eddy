The `kill` function allows the owner to destroy the contract if the balance is 0. The `mineIsBigger` function allows anyone to become the new owner if they send more ether than the current balance of the contract. The `withdraw` function allows the owner to withdraw all the ether from the contract after a certain deadline.",
