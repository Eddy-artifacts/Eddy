the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n  - When the second argument does not equal to 0, and the balance of the first argument is not smaller than the third argument, and (the balance of the second argument+the third argument) is greater than the balance of the second argument:\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n    - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When (the balance of the first argument+the second argument) is greater than the balance of the first argument, and the first argument does not equal to 0, and the balance of caller is not smaller than the second argument:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `icoratio` is typed uint256,public state variable `icoendtime` is typed uint256,public state variable `icosender` is typed address,public state variable `icoholder` is typed address.\n ",
