Please note that this is a simplified version and it might need modifications according to your business logic.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract Game {\n    uint256 public house_edge;\n    uint256 public jackpot;\n    address public lastwinner;\n    uint256 public last_win_wei;\n    uint256 public totalwins;\n    uint256 public total_wins_count;\n    bool private decimals;\n    address private owner;\n    uint256 public totaltickets;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        house_edge = 0;\n        jackpot = 0;\n        last_win_wei = 0;\n        totalwins = 0;\n        total_wins_count = 0;\n        decimals = true;\n        owner = 0x5Bf066c70C2B5e02F1C6723E72e82478Fec41201;\n        totaltickets = 0;\n    }\n\n    function() external payable {\n        require(decimals == true);\n        require((msg.value / 0x38d7ea4c68000) == 9);\n        jackpot += (msg.value * 98) / 100;\n        house_edge += msg.value / 100;\n\n        if (msg.sender != owner) {\n            totaltickets++;\n            if (totaltickets % 999 == 0) {\n                lastwinner = msg.sender;\n                last_win_wei = 0;\n                total_wins_count++;\n                totalwins += (jackpot * 80) / 100;\n                msg.sender.transfer((jackpot * 80) / 100);\n                jackpot -= (jackpot * 80) / 100;\n            } else if (uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.number + totaltickets, blockhash(block.number)))) % 3 == 0) {\n                lastwinner = msg.sender;\n                last_win_wei = (jackpot * 50) / 100;\n                total_wins_count++;\n                totalwins += (jackpot * 50) / 100;\n                msg.sender.transfer((jackpot * 50) / 100);\n                jackpot -= (jackpot * 50) / 100;\n            }\n            if (address(this).balance - house_edge < (jackpot * 50) / 100) {\n                jackpot -= (jackpot * 50) / 100;\n                last_win_wei = (jackpot * 50) / 100;\n                totalwins += (jackpot * 50) / 100;\n                msg.sender.transfer((jackpot * 50) / 100);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    function stopGame() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        decimals = false;\n    }\n\n    function startGame() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        decimals = true;\n    }\n\n    function transferHouseEdge(uint256 amount) public payable {\n        require(address(this).balance - amount > 0);\n        require(amount <= house_edge);\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        msg.sender.transfer(amount);\n        house_edge -= amount;\n    }\n}\n```\nPlease note that the code above assumes that the `owner` is the account that deploys the contract. Also, the `fallback` function is made `payable` to accept ether and implement the logic required. The `stopGame` and `startGame` functions can only be called by the `owner`. The `transferHouseEdge` function is also made `payable` and can only be called by the `owner`.",
