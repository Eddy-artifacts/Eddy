the balance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the second argument+the balance from the first argument to caller).\n\nFor the changeFeeTake function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the first argument is not smaller than feerebate, and the first argument is not greater than feetake, and for admin:\n  - the state variable feetake will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the changeAccountLevelsAddr function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For admin:\n  - the state variable accountlevelsaddr will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the testTrade function, it has 12 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address, uint8, bytes32, bytes32, uint256, address.\n- When the 11-th argument is not greater than the balance from the first argument to the 12-th argument:\n  - it calls a built-in function sha256 with the following argument list: the address of this contract, the first argument, the second argument, (the third argument*0x1000000000000000000000000), the fourth argument, the fifth argument, and the sixth argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it calls a built-in function ecrecover with the following argument list: SHA3(0x19457468657265756d205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a3332,v0), the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\nFor the payable deposit function.\n- When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the admin of caller) is not smaller than the admin of caller, and (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the admin of caller) is not smaller than the ether just received (i.e., msg.value):\n  - the admin of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the admin of caller).\n\nFor the withdrawToken function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the first argument is not 0, and the second argument is not greater than the balance from the first argument to caller:\n  - the balance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the balance from the first argument to caller-the second argument).\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and the second argument.\n\nFor the availableVolume function, it has 10 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address, uint8, bytes32, bytes32.\n- it calls a built-in function sha256 with the following argument list: the address of this contract, the first argument, the second argument, (the third argument*0x1000000000000000000000000), the fourth argument, the fifth argument, and the sixth argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n- When the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n  - it calls a built-in function ecrecover with the following argument list: SHA3(0x19457468657265756d205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a3332,v0), the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `addressOfBountyMembers` is typed array,public state variable `admin` is typed uint160,public state variable `feeaccount` is typed address,public state variable `accountlevelsaddr` is typed address,public state variable `feemake` is typed uint256,public state variable `feetake` is typed uint256,public state variable `feerebate` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `orders` is typed mapping,public state variable `orderfills` is typed mapping.\n ",
