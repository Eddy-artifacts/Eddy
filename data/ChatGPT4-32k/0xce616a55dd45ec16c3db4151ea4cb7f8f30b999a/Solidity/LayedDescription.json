				"content": "In Solidity, contracts can not only perform computations and store data, but they can also call other contracts. Here is a simple contract that uses a fallback function to delegate a call to another contract.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract DelegateCallContract {\n    address constant targetAddress = 0x0532fd6E1109756bE1503dAbe7194B70dF0257A7;\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        (bool success,) = targetAddress.delegatecall(msg.data);\n        require(success, \"Delegatecall failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a fallback function that is triggered when the call data is empty and no function matches the given function identifier, or when no data was supplied at all.\n\nThe `delegatecall` function is a low-level function similar to `call`. However, the code at the target address is executed in the context of the calling contract and `msg.sender` and `msg.value` do not change their values.\n\nThis means that a contract can dynamically load code from a different address at runtime. Storage, current address and balance still refer to the calling contract, only the code is taken from the called address.\n\nThis makes it possible to implement the \"library\" feature in Solidity: Reusable library code that can be applied to a contract's storage, e.g. in order to implement a complex data structure.\n\nThe `delegatecall` function returns a boolean indicating whether the called function executed successfully or not, and if not, it reverts all changes.",
