Also note that the logic states that `v0` should be equal to `msg.value` and `0` at the same time which is not possible. Please revise this condition. \n\nThis contract also assumes that `mperselldata` and `minviteaddr` contracts have functions `GetPerSellInfo` and `GetAddressByName` respectively. You would need to replace them with the actual function names and arguments if they are different.",
