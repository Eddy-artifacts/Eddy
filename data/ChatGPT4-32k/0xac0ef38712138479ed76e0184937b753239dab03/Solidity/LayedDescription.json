It checks if the received Ether is equal or greater than `price`. Then, it transfers a portion of the Ether to `owner`, `owner1`, and `owner2`. It also calculates and transfers rewards to the sender based on the amount of their deposit and the number of blocks since their last change. Finally, it updates the `showdeposit` and `showlastchange` of the sender.",
