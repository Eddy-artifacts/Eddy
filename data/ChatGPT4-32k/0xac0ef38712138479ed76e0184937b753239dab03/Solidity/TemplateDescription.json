As required, the contract uses `pragma solidity 0.6.12;` to lock the compiler version. The contract uses the `receive()` function as a payable fallback function. The function checks if the `msg.value` is greater than or equal to the price and then performs the necessary calculations and transfers. The contract also includes the required checks for overflow and underflow, and it checks if the sender's address is empty before transferring ether to them. The contract uses the `block.number` property to get the current block number. The contract does not import any external resources and it does not use any of the old methods.",
