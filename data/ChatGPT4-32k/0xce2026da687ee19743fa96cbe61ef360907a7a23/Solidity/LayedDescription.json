Afterthat, \n    - the balance of the address of this contract will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- When buyprice is not 0, and the balance of the address of this contract is not smaller than (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/buyprice):\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller+(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/buyprice)).\n  - the balance of the address of this contract will be updated to (the balance of the address of this contract-(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/buyprice)).\n\nFor the changeOwner function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner2:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n- the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n- the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n\nFor the setPriceInWei function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- For owner2:\n  - When the first argument equals to 0:\n    - the state variable buyprice will be updated to (the first argument*0x2540be400).\n  - When ((the first argument*0x2540be400)/the first argument) equals to 0x2540be400, and the first argument does not equal to 0, and the first argument is not 0:\n    - the state variable buyprice will be updated to (the first argument*0x2540be400).\n\nFor the sendEtherToOwner function.\n- For owner2:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to owner.\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When the first argument does not equal to 0, and for owner2:\n  - the state variable owner2 will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n- the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,private state variable `owner2` is typed address,public state variable `initialsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `buyprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8.\n ",
