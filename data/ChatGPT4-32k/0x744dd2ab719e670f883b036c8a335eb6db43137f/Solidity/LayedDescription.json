Similarly, the condition `msg.value is 0` is not valid in Solidity. If you wanted to check whether `msg.value` is zero, you would use `msg.value == 0`.\n\nThe complicated condition checks you've described involve many nested conditions and calculations that are not typically seen in Solidity contracts. If you can simplify these requirements or provide more context, I could help you design a more effective contract.",
