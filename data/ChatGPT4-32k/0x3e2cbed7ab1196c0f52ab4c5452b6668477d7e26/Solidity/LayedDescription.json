The `withdraw` function allows users to withdraw ether from their balance. If the transfer fails for whatever reason, their balance will be reverted to its initial state before the withdrawal attempt. The `getBalance` function is used to get the current balance of the caller. The owner of the contract is initially set to the address that deploys the contract.",
