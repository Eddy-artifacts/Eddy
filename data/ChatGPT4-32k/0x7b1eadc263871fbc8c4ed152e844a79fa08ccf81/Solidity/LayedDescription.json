				"content": "Sure, below is a simple contract that fulfills the given description. The contract includes a fallback function that delegates a call to the specified address (0x3572C5F13deC57Af49FBaD9c24a1E66360B3f463).\n\nPlease note that the contract uses assembly code for the delegatecall to provide low-level access to this operation. \n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    // This is the address we will make delegate calls to.\n    address public constant delegateToAddress = 0x3572C5F13deC57Af49FBaD9c24a1E66360B3f463;\n    \n    // Payable fallback function.\n    fallback() external payable {\n        // Delegate the call to the target contract.\n        assembly {\n            // Copy msg.data (function selector and function arguments)\n            let ptr := mload(0x40)\n            calldatacopy(ptr, 0, calldatasize())\n            \n            // delegatecall to the target contract\n            let result := delegatecall(gas(), delegateToAddress, ptr, calldatasize(), 0, 0)\n            let size := returndatasize()\n            \n            // copy returndata (whatever the delegate call returned)\n            returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)\n\n            switch result\n            case 0 { revert(ptr, size) } // delegatecall failed, revert.\n            default { return(ptr, size) } // delegatecall succeeded, return data.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that directly using assembly in contracts is dangerous and can lead to vulnerabilities if not done correctly. This is due to the fact that it bypasses Solidity\u2019s safety checks. It's recommended to only use it as a last resort when it's absolutely necessary and you're sure about what you're doing.\n",
