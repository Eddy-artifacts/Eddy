Please note that the contract has a modifier `onlyAdmin` to handle the logic for only admin. The required fallback function is also included. Note that the contract does not handle the logic for changing the admin, and the `last_completed_migration1` state variable is updated by casting the address to uint256. Remember to replace `\"CALLDATACOPY@0x315\"` with the actual function signature you want to call.",
