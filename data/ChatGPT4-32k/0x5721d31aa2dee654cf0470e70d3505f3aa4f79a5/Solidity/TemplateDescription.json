If the contract is deployed with 0 ether, the `owner2` variable is set to the deployer's address. \n\nThe `safeTransfer` function is used to safely transfer ether from the contract to another address. It first checks if the recipient address is not zero and if the contract has enough balance. It then uses a `.call()` to transfer the ether and checks if the transfer was successful. \n\nPlease note that this contract does not include overflow or underflow checks as there are no arithmetic operations. Also, it doesn't use the specified built-in functions and properties as they are not needed based on the provided description.",
