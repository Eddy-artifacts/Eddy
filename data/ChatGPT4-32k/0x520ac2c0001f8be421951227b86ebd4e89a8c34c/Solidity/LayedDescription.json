Please note that the description provided is not very clear and I made some assumptions about your intended functionality. \n\n```solidity\npragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;\n\ncontract ManagerContract {\n    address[] private addressOfBountyMembers;\n    uint256 private totalSupply;\n    uint256 private totalSupply1;\n    uint256 private totalSupply2;\n    address public _last_create_address;\n\n    function managerSet() public {\n        require(msg.sender != address(0), \"Caller address cannot be 0\");\n        require(totalSupply != 0, \"Total supply cannot be 0\");\n\n        addressOfBountyMembers[0] = address(0);\n        addressOfBountyMembers[1] = address(1);\n        addressOfBountyMembers[2] = address(totalSupply);\n    }\n\n    function managerPropose(address _address) public {\n        require(msg.sender != addressOfBountyMembers[0], \"Caller must not be the first bounty member\");\n        totalSupply = uint256(_address);\n    }\n\n    function getCapital(address _address, uint256 _amount) public payable {\n        require(addressOfBountyMembers[0] != address(0), \"First bounty member must exist\");\n\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n\n        if(_address != address(0)) {\n            // Assuming the transfer function of _address has the following signature:\n            // transfer(address receiver, uint256 numTokens)\n            (bool success, ) = _address.call(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"transfer(address,uint256)\", msg.sender, _amount));\n            require(success, \"External transfer failed.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract includes three functions `managerSet`, `managerPropose`, and `getCapital` as per your description. In `managerSet`, we are setting the first three elements of `addressOfBountyMembers` to 0, 1, and `totalSupply` respectively. In `managerPropose`, we are setting `totalSupply` to the numeric representation of an input address. And in `getCapital`, we are transferring ether to the caller and if the input address is not 0, we are calling an external transfer function of the input address.",
