The contract uses delegatecall in the fallback function to delegate all calls to an implementation contract. The implementation contract can be changed by the `upgradeabilityowner` through the `upgradeTo` and `upgradeToAndCall` functions. \n\nPlease note that this contract doesn't have any logic for your complex conditions. It's hard to implement the contract based on the provided complex condition due to the lack of context and purpose of those conditions.",
