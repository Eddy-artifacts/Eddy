They should be implemented in a similar way, with the appropriate calculations and checks as described in the contract descriptions. When implementing the logic for updating the `lasthatch` and `claimedeggs` mappings, you should use the `msg.sender` keyword to refer to the address of the caller. Also, when transferring ether, you should use the `transfer` function on the `address` type, e.g., `ceoaddress.transfer(amount)`.",
