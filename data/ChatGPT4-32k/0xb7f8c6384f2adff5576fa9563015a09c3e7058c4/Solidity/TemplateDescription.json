You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

it transfers ether valued (0-((4*0)/100)) to caller.\n      - When totalSupply1 is not 0, and 0 is 0:\n        - it transfers ether valued 0 to ceoaddress.\n        - it transfers ether valued 0 to caller.\n  - When (current time-the lasthatch of the address) is 0:\n    - the state variable marketeggs will be updated to (the claimedeggs of the address+marketeggs).\n    - When totalSupply is 0:\n      - When totalSupply1 is 0, and 0 is not 0:\n        -

it transfers ether valued 0 to caller.\n\nFor the payable buyEggs function.\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is not 0, and initialized is not 0:\n  - it transfers ((4*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))/100) to ceoaddress.\n  - When totalSupply is 0:\n    - When totalSupply1 is 0, and 0 is not 0:\n      - the claimedeggs of caller will be updated to ((0-((4*0)/100))+the claimedeggs of the address).\n    - When totalSupply1 is not 0, and 0 is 0:\n      - the claimedeggs of caller will be updated to (0+the claimedeggs of the address).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `eggs_to_hatch_1dino` is typed uint256,public state variable `starting_dino` is typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply` is typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply1` is typed uint256,public state variable `ceoaddress` is typed address,public state variable `initialized` is typed bool,public state variable `hatcherydino` is typed mapping,public state variable `claimedeggs` is typed mapping,public state variable `lasthatch` is typed mapping,public state variable `referrals` is typed mapping,public state variable `marketeggs` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
