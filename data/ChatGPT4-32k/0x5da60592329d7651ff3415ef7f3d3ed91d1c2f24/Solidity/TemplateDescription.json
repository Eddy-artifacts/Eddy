The `transferOwnership` function enables the contract `owner` to transfer ownership to another Ethereum address. The `withdraw` function allows the `owner` to withdraw a specified amount of Ether to a recipient's address. \n\nPlease test and audit this contract thoroughly before using it in production, as it's a simple example and doesn't include advanced features like access control, error messages, or events.",
