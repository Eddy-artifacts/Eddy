This contract assumes that the `tokenreward` contract is an ERC20 token, and that it has a `transfer` function that takes an address and a value as arguments. \n\nThe `fallback` function is triggered when the contract receives Ether without any other function being called. This function is marked as `external` and `payable`, meaning it can receive Ether and can only be called from outside the contract.\n\nThe `safeWithdrawal` function makes sure that only the `payoutaddr` can withdraw the Ether after the deadline. \n\nThe `closeSale` function can be called by anyone after the deadline to pause the contract. \n\nPlease review and test this contract thoroughly before using it. Solidity and smart contract development requires careful handling to avoid any potential security issues.",
