Then, it defines a contract `YourContract` with four state variables: `creator`, `tokencontract`, `tokenprice`, and `deadline`.\n\nThe `setDeadline`, `payout`, and `setPrice` functions can only be called by the `creator` of the contract. The `buyTokens` function can be called by anyone before the `deadline` and when the `tokenprice` is greater than 0. It calculates the number of tokens to buy with the received ether and calls the `transfer` function of the `tokencontract` to transfer the tokens.\n\nThe `receive` function is a fallback function to accept ether sent to the contract.",
