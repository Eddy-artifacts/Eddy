the balance of caller will be updated to (airamount+the balance of caller).\n    - the aircount of caller will be updated to (the aircount of caller+1).\n\nFor the payable ico function.\n- When (((icoratio*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))*10 EXP decimals)/0xde0b6b3a7640000) is not 0, and (((icoratio*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))*10 EXP decimals)/0xde0b6b3a7640000) is not greater than the balance of icosender, and caller is not 0, and after icobegintime, and (the balance of caller+(((icoratio*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))*10 EXP decimals)/0xde0b6b3a7640000)) is greater than the balance of caller, and before icoendtime:\n  - the balance of icosender will be updated to (the balance of icosender-(((icoratio*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))*10 EXP decimals)/0xde0b6b3a7640000)).\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to ((((icoratio*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))*10 EXP decimals)/0xde0b6b3a7640000)+the balance of caller).\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the first argument is not 0, and (the balance of the first argument+the second argument) is greater than the balance of the first argument, and the second argument is not greater than the balance of caller:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `airamount` is typed uint256,public state variable `airbegintime` is typed uint256,public state variable `airendtime` is typed uint256,public state variable `airlimitcount` is typed uint32,public state variable `airsender` is typed address,public state variable `aircountof` is typed mapping,public state variable `icoratio` is typed uint256,public state variable `icobegintime` is typed uint256,public state variable `icoendtime` is typed uint256,public state variable `icosender` is typed address,public state variable `icoholder` is typed address.\n ",
