Anybody can call the `set` function to update the message state variable if they send enough ether with the call and the length of the new message is not greater than maxlength. The price in wei to call the `set` function doubles after each successful call. The `withdraw` function allows the contract owner to transfer a specific amount of wei to a specified address.",
