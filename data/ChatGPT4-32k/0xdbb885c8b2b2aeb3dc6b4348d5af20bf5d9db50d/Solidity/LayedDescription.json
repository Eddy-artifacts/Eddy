The `balances` and `time` are mappings from user addresses to `uint`s. They are public, so they are accessible outside the contract but can be modified only within this contract. The `alldeposits`, `allpercents`, `allbeneficiaries`, and `lastpayment` variables are also public, so they are accessible and modifiable both inside and outside the contract. The `totalSupply1`, `totalSupply2`, `totalSupply3`, `totalSupply4`, `totalSupply5` are private, so they can only be accessed and modified within this contract.",
