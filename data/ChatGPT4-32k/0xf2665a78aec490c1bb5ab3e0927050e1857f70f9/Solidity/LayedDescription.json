These variables can be updated by the payable constructor when there is no ether received. The safeWithdrawal function allows the investors to withdraw their investments if the ICO has ended and the softcap has not been reached. The chefOwnerWithdrawal function allows the chefowner to withdraw the total amount if the ICO has ended and the softcap has been reached. The fallback function is used to accept ether from investors and update the totalamount, balanceof, and chefbalanceof. It also checks if the softcap or hardcap has been reached and updates the respective state variables accordingly.",
