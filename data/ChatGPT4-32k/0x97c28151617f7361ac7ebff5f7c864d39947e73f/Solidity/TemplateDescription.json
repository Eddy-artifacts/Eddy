Please note that all the safety checks have been added. The contract has a constructor to initialize the investor variable, a fallback function to handle the investments, an approveInvestor function to approve a new investor, and a sendInvestor function to transfer funds to the investor. The fallback function updates the state variables atblock and invested when an investor sends ether to the contract. If the investor had a non-zero investment, it first calculates the amount to be sent back to the investor and sends it before updating the variables.",
