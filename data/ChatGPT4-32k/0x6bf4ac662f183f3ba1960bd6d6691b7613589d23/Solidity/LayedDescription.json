If it is, it calls the `sendDividends` function of the `token` contract and sends all the contract's balance as dividends to the corresponding admin address. If the sender is not one of the admin addresses, the function reverts the transaction. The `token` contract is an instance of the `IToken` interface, which has the `sendDividends` function that should be implemented in the actual token contract. The contract's constructor sets the initial values for the `token` and the admin addresses.",
