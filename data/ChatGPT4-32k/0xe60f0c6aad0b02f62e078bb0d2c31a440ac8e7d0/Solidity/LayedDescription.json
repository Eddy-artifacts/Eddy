The fallback function is marked as `external` meaning it can only be executed from an external account or another contract. It is also marked as `payable` so that it can receive Ether. \n\nThe function first checks if the sender has made an investment before. If so, it calculates the amount of Ether to return to the sender based on the difference between the current block number and the block number at which the sender made an investment, as well as the amount of Ether the sender invested. The function then transfers the calculated amount back to the sender. \n\nAfter that, the function updates the block number and the amount of Ether invested by the sender.",
