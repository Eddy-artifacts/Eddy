The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the current owner can call certain functions.\n\nThe `renounceOwnership` function sets the `owner` address to the zero address, effectively renouncing ownership of the contract.\n\nThe `send` function transfers Ether from the contract to a specified address. It first checks that the address is not the zero address and that the contract has enough Ether to send.\n\nThe `transferOwnership` function changes the owner of the contract to a new address, again checking that the new owner is not the zero address.",
