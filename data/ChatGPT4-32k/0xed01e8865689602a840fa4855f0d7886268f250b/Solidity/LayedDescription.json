At contract deployment, the `owner` is set to the deployer, the `price` to `0x38d7ea4c68000`, and `count` to 0.\n2. The `toggle` function can be called by anyone. If the caller sends enough Ether (at least `price`), `count` is incremented by 1.\n3. The `withdraw` function can be called by the owner to withdraw all the Ether from the contract.\n4. The `renounceOwnership` function will allow the owner to renounce his ownership over the contract.\n5. The `transferOwnership` function will allow the owner to transfer his ownership to another Ethereum address. The new owner's address cannot be the zero address.",
