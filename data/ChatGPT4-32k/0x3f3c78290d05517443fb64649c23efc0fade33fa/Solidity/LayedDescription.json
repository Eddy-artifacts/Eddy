If the message sender is the current owner, ownership is transferred to the new owner.\n- In the `withdraw` function, multiple conditions are checked: the amount must be greater than 0, the recipient's address must not be the zero address, and the contract balance must be sufficient for the withdrawal. If the message sender is the owner, the specified amount is transferred to the recipient's address.",
