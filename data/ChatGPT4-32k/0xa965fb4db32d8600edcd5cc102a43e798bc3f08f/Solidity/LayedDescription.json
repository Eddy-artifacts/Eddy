You'll need to carefully implement these functions keeping in mind the logic you've described while ensuring proper checks and safety measures are in place to prevent exploits such as re-entrancy attacks, overflow/underflow errors, and more. \n\nIn Ethereum smart contracts, safety and security should always be a top priority.",
