The `balanceOf` function of the `Token` contract is called to get the token balance of an address, and the `transfer` function is used to transfer tokens from the contract to a user.",

Before (0x76a700+completedat):\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to 0.\n    - the ethoncontract of caller will be updated to 0.\n    - it calls an external function transferFrom of the external contract tokenreward with the following argument list: caller, the address of this contract, and the tokenssent of caller, and gets the returned value as v0. Afterthat, \n      - the tokenssent of caller will be updated to 0.\n    - When v0 is not 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - it transfers ether valued the ethoncontract of caller to caller.\n  - After (0x76a700+completedat), and the balance of caller is not smaller than 2:\n    - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract tokenreward with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to creator.\n      - When the call or transfer fails:\n        - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokenreward with the following argument list: creator, and v1.\n\nFor the claimEth function.\n- When totaldistributed is not smaller than softcap, and 2 is not greater than the balance of caller:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to creator.\n\nFor the successful function.\n- When state equals to 4:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to creator.\n  - After (0x127500+completedat):\n    - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract tokenreward with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokenreward with the following argument list: creator, and v0.\n\nFor the adminshipLevel function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint8.\n- When 2 is not greater than the balance of caller, and the first argument is not 0:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the claimTokensByUser function.\n- When 1 equals to the kycvalid of caller:\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokenreward with the following argument list: caller, and the balance of caller, and gets the returned value as v0. Afterthat, \n    - the balance of caller will be updated to 0.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds, and v0 is not 0:\n    - the tokenssent of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller+the tokenssent of caller).\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- When state does not equal to 3, and state is not greater than 4, and 1 equals to the whitelist of caller, and state does not equal to 4, and state does not equal to 2, and the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is not smaller than 0x16345785d8a0000:\n  - the state variable totalraised will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+totalraised).\n  - the ethoncontract of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the ethoncontract of caller).\n  - When totaldistributed is not greater than hardcap:\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to the balance of caller.\n    - the state variable totaldistributed will be updated to totaldistributed.\n\nFor the payable contribute function.\n- When state does not equal to 3, and state is not greater than 4, and 1 equals to the whitelist of caller, and state does not equal to 4, and state does not equal to 2, and the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is not smaller than 0x16345785d8a0000:\n  - the state variable totalraised will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+totalraised).\n  - the ethoncontract of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the ethoncontract of caller).\n  - When totaldistributed is not greater than hardcap:\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to the balance of caller.\n    - the state variable totaldistributed will be updated to totaldistributed.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `balanceOf` is typed mapping,public state variable `state` is typed uint8,public state variable `presalestart` is typed uint256,public state variable `mainsalestart` is typed uint256,public state variable `mainsaledeadline` is typed uint256,public state variable `completedat` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalraised` is typed uint256,public state variable `presaledistributed` is typed uint256,public state variable `totaldistributed` is typed uint256,public state variable `tokenreward` is typed address,public state variable `softcap` is typed uint256,public state variable `hardcap` is typed uint256,public state variable `ethoncontract` is typed mapping,public state variable `tokenssent` is typed mapping,public state variable `balance` is typed mapping,public state variable `creator` is typed address,public state variable `version` is typed string,public state variable `whitelist` is typed mapping,public state variable `kycvalid` is typed mapping.\n ",
