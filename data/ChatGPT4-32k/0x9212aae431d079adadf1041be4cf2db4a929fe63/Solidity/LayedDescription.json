The above code follows the logic you provided, however, it's unlikely to work as expected because `687 CODECOPY@0x2aa` doesn't represent a valid contract creation code and I had to make some assumptions to convert your logic into Solidity. \n\nThe `notify` function first checks if string length is not greater than `0x100000000` and then based on the length it tries to create a new smart contract with the given creation code. The creation code is derived from the string argument using inline assembly. \n\nPlease, make sure to properly test this contract in a safe environment before deploying it to the live network.",
