There are several state variables declared and a constructor which sets the initial state of the contract. The contract also implements several functions corresponding to the given logic. For example, the `buy` function checks whether the current state is 1 and the sent Ether is not 0, then it calculates the amount of tokens that should be transferred from the owner to the contract itself. It also updates the balance of the caller and the total Ether collected and tokens sold. The `fallback` function handles incoming Ether transfers and executes different logic based on the current state of the contract. The `withdraw` and `withdrawTokens` functions allow the owner to withdraw collected Ether and users to withdraw their tokens.",
