				"content": "The contract you described is quite complex and it seems like a lottery system. I will implement a simplified version, as Solidity doesn't support SHA3 hash function, we will use keccak256 hash function instead.

For example, it was not clear what the variable \"OR\" is supposed to refer to. Also, it's not possible to catch transfer failures in Solidity, so I have not included that part in this contract.",
