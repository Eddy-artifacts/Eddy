Also, the code uses the `keccak256` function instead of `SHA3` because Solidity does not provide a built-in `SHA3` function. `keccak256` is a version of the SHA-3 hash function. Also, the contract may require additional functions for full ERC20 and Ownable functionality, and the contract may require additional security measures for a production environment.",
