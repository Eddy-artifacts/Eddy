it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n- When 0 is smaller than the third argument:\n  - When 32 is not smaller than the third argument:\n    - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n  - When 32 is smaller than the third argument:\n    - When 64 is not smaller than the third argument:\n      - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n    - When 64 is smaller than the third argument:\n      - When 96 is not smaller than the third argument:\n        - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n      - When 96 is smaller than the third argument:\n        - When 128 is not smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n        - When 160 is not smaller than the third argument, and 128 is smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n\nFor the payable depositAndTransfer function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, bytes.\n- the balance of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the balance of caller).\n- the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+totalsupply).\n- When the first argument is not 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n  - When 0 is not smaller than the third argument:\n    - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n  - When 0 is smaller than the third argument:\n    - When 32 is not smaller than the third argument:\n      - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n    - When 32 is smaller than the third argument:\n      - When 64 is not smaller than the third argument:\n        - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n      - When 64 is smaller than the third argument:\n        - When 96 is not smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n        - When 96 is smaller than the third argument:\n          - When 128 is not smaller than the third argument:\n            - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n          - When 160 is not smaller than the third argument, and 128 is smaller than the third argument:\n            - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `accesspolicy` is typed address,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `version` is typed string.\n ",
