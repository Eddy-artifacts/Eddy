it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n        - When 96 is smaller than the third argument:\n          - When 128 is not smaller than the third argument:\n            - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n          - When 160 is not smaller than the third argument, and 128 is smaller than the third argument:\n            - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, bytes.\n- When the first argument is not 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n  - When 0 is not smaller than the third argument:\n    - it calls an external function onTokenTransfer of the first argument.\n  - When 0 is smaller than the third argument:\n    - When 32 is not smaller than the third argument:\n      - it calls an external function onTokenTransfer of the first argument.\n    - When 32 is smaller than the third argument:\n      - When 64 is not smaller than the third argument:\n        - it calls an external function onTokenTransfer of the first argument.\n      - When 64 is smaller than the third argument:\n        - When 96 is not smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function onTokenTransfer of the first argument.\n        - When 96 is smaller than the third argument:\n          -

it calls an external function onTokenTransfer of the first argument.\n\nFor the reclaim function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When the first argument is not 0:\n  - it calls an external function allowed of the external contract accesspolicy with the following argument list: caller, 0x542bbd0c672578966dcc525b30aa16723bb042675554ac5b0362f86b6e97dc5, the address of this contract, and the first argument and 0xffffffff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 and 0xffffffff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds, and v0 is not 0:\n    - it calls an external function balanceOf of the first argument with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and v1.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `accesspolicy` is typed address,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `version` is typed string.\n ",
