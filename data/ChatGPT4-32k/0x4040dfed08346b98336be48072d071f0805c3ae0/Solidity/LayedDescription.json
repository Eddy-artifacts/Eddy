However, the logic behind the computation of the `decimals`, `totalsupply`, `balanceof` in the constructor is quite complex and unusual, it's hard to implement it into solidity without knowing the exact purpose and the data type of `symbol` and `name`. Also, the logic behind the `approveAndCall` function is unclear.",
