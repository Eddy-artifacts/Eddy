				"content": "Sure, here is a basic smart contract based on your requirements. However, please provide the type of the state variables, because it's necessary to write a correct Solidity contract. In this example, I assume all variables as uint type.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.6;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    uint public s_3;\n    uint public s_16_31_32;\n    uint public deadline;\n    \n    constructor() payable {\n        s_3 = 0x5c814e10;\n        s_16_31_32 = 0;\n        \n        if (msg.value == 0) {\n            deadline = block.timestamp + 0x278d00;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that Solidity uses Unix timestamps (the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00) to represent time. I used `block.timestamp` to get the current time.\n\nAlso note that this contract doesn't do anything with the ether sent to it. In a real-world contract, you would want to do something with received ether, like storing it or transferring it to another address. \n\nPlease provide more detailed requirements if you need a more complex contract.",
