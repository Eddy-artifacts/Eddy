If the constructor receives no ether (i.e., `msg.value` is 0), the `deadline` is set to the current timestamp plus 0x278d00. \n\nPlease note that this contract does not include the external calls, safemath operations, check for empty address, and the use of the new methods `abi.encodePacked`, `keccak256`, `sha256`, `ecrecover`, and properties `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, `blockhash` as they were not required in the given contract description. If you need those features, please provide a more specific contract description.",
