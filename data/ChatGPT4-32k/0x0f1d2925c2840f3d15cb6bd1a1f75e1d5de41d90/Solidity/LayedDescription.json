Also, the peek() function is not defined in the ERC20 standard, so you would need to make sure the token contract you're interacting with does have this function.\n",

Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the acceptOwnership function.\n- For newowner:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to newowner. Afterthat, \n    - the state variable newowner will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the approve function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the getPriceETH_USD function.\n- it statically calls an external function peek of the external contract token.\n\nFor the transferAnyERC20Token function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: owner, and the second argument.\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable newowner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the burn function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the first argument is not greater than totalsupply:\n  - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the first argument).\n  - When the first argument is not greater than the balance of caller:\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-(the balance of caller-the first argument)).\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When the third argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - When the third argument is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller:\n    -
