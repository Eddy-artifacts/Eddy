Implementing all of the functionality you've described would result in a much larger and more complex contract. Also, it's important to note that the original question contains several repetitions and contradictions which makes it difficult to implement in a real contract. The contract provided is to illustrate a simple structure based on the provided requirements. It's not a production-ready contract and it's not recommended to deploy it on the mainnet as it is.",
