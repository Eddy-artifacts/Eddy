				"content": "Here is a skeleton for your contract in Solidity.

Continue with the rest of your functions here ...\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this contract does not implement the full logic you described. It only creates the state variables and the constructor function based on your description. The logic you described for your constructor function is not directly translatable to Solidity due to the use of SHA3 function with non-standard arguments and complex conditions.\n\nThis contract uses the version pragma ^0.4.24, but you should use the most recent version of Solidity that's compatible with the rest of your codebase. Also, the logic in your functions like `withdrawEther`, `withdrawTokens`, `transferFrom`, `transfer`, `approveAndCall`, `transferAnyERC20Token`, `transferOwnership` is not implemented because it was not possible to fit all of it in this response.",
