Note that it does not use external calls, so it does not use the `.call()` method. Also, it does not perform arithmetic operations that could potentially overflow or underflow, so it does not require SafeMath operations. Finally, this contract does not check if user's address is empty before transferring Ether as it is not explicitly required in the problem statement.",
