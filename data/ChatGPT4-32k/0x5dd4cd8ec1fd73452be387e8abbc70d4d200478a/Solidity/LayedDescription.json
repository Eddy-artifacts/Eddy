Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the setTokenStakingContract function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- the state variable tokenstakingcontractaddress will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the proxyDepositToken function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- the usertokenbalance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the usertokenbalance of the first argument).\n- the state variable totaltokenbalance will be updated to (the second argument+totaltokenbalance).\n\nFor the withdrawTokens function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not greater than the usertokenbalance of the first argument:\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract token with the following argument list: the first argument, and the second argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When v0 is not 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - the usertokenbalance of the first argument will be updated to (the usertokenbalance of the first argument-the second argument).\n    - the state variable totaltokenbalance will be updated to (totaltokenbalance-the second argument).\n\nFor the setAccessLevel function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not greater than 4, and 4 is greater than the accesslevel of the first argument, and 4 equals to the accesslevel of caller, and the second argument is not smaller than 0:\n  - the accesslevel of the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the delegatedAllowance function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address.\n- it statically calls an external function allowance of the external contract token with the following argument list: the first argument, and the second argument.\n\nFor the setAugurUniverse function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- the state variable auguruniverseaddress will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the checkTotalBalanceExternal function.\n- it statically calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token with the address of this contract as the argument.\n- When the call or transfer succeeds:\n  -

it calls an external function transferFrom of the external contract token with the following argument list: the first argument, the address of this contract, and v0, and gets the returned value as v1.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds, and v1 is not 0:\n    - the usertokenbalance of the first argument will be updated to (v0+the usertokenbalance of the first argument).\n    - the state variable totaltokenbalance will be updated to (v0+totaltokenbalance).\n\nFor the delegatedTotalSupply function.\n- it statically calls an external function totalSupply of the external contract token.\n\nFor the revokeAccess function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When 4 is greater than the accesslevel of the first argument, and 4 equals to the accesslevel of caller:\n  - the accesslevel of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the delegatedStake function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- it calls an external function stake of the external contract tokenstakingcontractaddress with the first argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n- When v0 is not 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n  - the state variable stakedtokensreceivable will be updated to (the first argument+stakedtokensreceivable).\n  - the state variable approvedtokenspayable will be updated to (approvedtokenspayable-the first argument).\n\nFor the delegatedApprove function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When 4 equals to the accesslevel of caller:\n  - it calls an external function watch_tg_invmru_2f69f1b of the external contract token with the following argument list: the first argument, and the second argument.\n\nFor the makeDeposit function.\n- it statically calls an external function allowance of the external contract token with the following argument list: caller, and the address of this contract, and gets the returned value as v0.\n- When the call or transfer succeeds:\n  -
