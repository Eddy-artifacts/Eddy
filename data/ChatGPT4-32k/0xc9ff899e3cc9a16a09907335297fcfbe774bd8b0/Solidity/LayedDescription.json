				"content": "Apologies for the confusion, but your requirements seem too complex and not very clear, especially in the mint function.

It also includes functions to transfer ownership of the contract, approve users to spend tokens on behalf of others, and withdraw ETH from the contract. This contract lacks some important security checks and does not fully conform to the ERC721 standard, but it should give you a starting point.",
