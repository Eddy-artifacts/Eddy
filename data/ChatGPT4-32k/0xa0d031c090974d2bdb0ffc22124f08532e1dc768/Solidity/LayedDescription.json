Also, some parts of the description are unclear (\"name is 0\" - name is a string in this context, so it's unclear what \"name is 0\" means) or don't seem to be reflected in the Solidity language (e.g., SHA3 is known as keccak256 in Solidity). The provided contract is a simplified version that omits these parts.",
