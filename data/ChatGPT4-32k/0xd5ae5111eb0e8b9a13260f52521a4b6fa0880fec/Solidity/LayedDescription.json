Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the external contract refpaystation will be updated to 0x4100dAdA0D80931008a5f7F5711FFEb60A8071BA.\n- the state variable winbalancetotal will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable bossbalance will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable ntsbalance will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n- the state variable prizebalance will be updated to the ether just received (i.e., msg.value).\n\nFor the payPrize function, it has 6 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, uint8, uint256, uint256, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not greater than prizebalance, and for owner:\n  - the winbalance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the winbalance of the first argument).\n  - the state variable winbalancetotal will be updated to (the second argument+winbalancetotal).\n  - the state variable prizebalance will be updated to (prizebalance-the second argument).\n\nFor the fundPrize function.\n- When (the balance of the address of this contract-(((winbalancetotal+bossbalance)+ntsbalance)+prizebalance)) is greater than 0, and for owner:\n  - the state variable prizebalance will be updated to ((the balance of the address of this contract-(((winbalancetotal+bossbalance)+ntsbalance)+prizebalance))+prizebalance).\n\nFor the payPostDrawRef function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When the third argument is not greater than prizebalance, and for owner:\n  - the state variable prizebalance will be updated to (prizebalance-the third argument).\n  - it calls an external function put of the external contract refpaystation with ether valued valued the third argument and the following argument list: the first argument, and the second argument.\n\nFor the payNTS function.\n- When 0 is smaller than ntsbalance, and for owner:\n  - it calls an external function fund of 0xad0a61589f3559026F00888027beAc31A5Ac4625 with ether valued valued ntsbalance\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - the state variable ntsbalance will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the correct function.\n- When (the balance of the address of this contract-(((winbalancetotal+bossbalance)+ntsbalance)+prizebalance)) is greater than 0, and for owner:\n  - the state variable bossbalance will be updated to ((the balance of the address of this contract-(((winbalancetotal+bossbalance)+ntsbalance)+prizebalance))+bossbalance).\n\nFor the payable makeBet function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: uint256, address.\n- After 0x5c1fb321:\n  - Before 0x5c538c00, and ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/0x16345785d8a0000)*0x16345785d8a0000) is greater than 0:\n    - the state variable prizebalance will be updated to ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)-((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/0x16345785d8a0000)*0x16345785d8a0000))+prizebalance).
