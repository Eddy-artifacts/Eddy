				"content": "Here's the Solidity contract code based on your description. \n\nPlease note that the given description is quite complex and some parts are not clear and seem to contain errors. This is a simplified version of your contract and does not reflect the full complexity of your description.\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address public owner;\n    uint256 public totalsupply;\n    mapping (address => uint) public balanceof;\n    string public name;\n    string public symbol;\n    string public standard;\n    uint8 public decimals;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        decimals = 18;\n        totalsupply = 0x33b2e3c9fd0803ce8000000;\n        balanceof[owner] = totalsupply + 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffd1789963cf78c95fc000000;\n        balanceof[address(this)] = 0x2e87669c308736a04000000;\n    }\n\n    function() external payable {\n        require(balanceof[address(this)] > 0);\n        balanceof[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n        balanceof[address(this)] -= msg.value;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);\n    }\n\n    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        owner = newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function killMe() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        selfdestruct(address(uint160(owner)));\n    }\n\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public {\n        require(balanceof[msg.sender] >= value);\n        balanceof[msg.sender] -= value;\n        balanceof[to] += value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract does not include the SHA3 logic you described as it's not clear how it should be implemented. Also, the contract does not include the logic for updating the `name`, `symbol`, and `standard` state variables as it's not clear when and how these variables should be updated. The logic for transferring ether in the fallback function is also simplified.\n\nPlease review this contract and provide more details if necessary.\n",
