The functions are implemented to meet the conditions and requirements you described. Please note that this contract assumes the existence of an external `transfer` function that is being called with `call`. If this function does not exist or have a different signature, you will need to adjust the `transfer` function accordingly. Also, you may want to add appropriate events to track contract activity and state changes.",
