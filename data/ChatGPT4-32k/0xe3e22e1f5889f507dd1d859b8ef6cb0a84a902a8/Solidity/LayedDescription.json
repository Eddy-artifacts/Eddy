For example, there are many conditions checking if the value of Ether sent (msg.value) is 0 and then transferring 0 Ether to diamonddividendaddr. Similarly, there are a lot of conditions in which the balance of the caller is updated to the current time (block.timestamp in Solidity), which might not make sense depending on the context of the contract. You might want to clarify these points in your contract description.",
