				"content": "Here is a simple smart contract that follows your description:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract DelegateCallContract {\n    // Define the target address who receives ether\n    address payable private target = 0x2A2b85EB1054d6f0c6c2E37dA05eD3E5feA684EF;\n\n    // Payable fallback function\n    fallback() external payable {\n        // Check the user's address is not empty\n        require(target != address(0), \"Target address cannot be 0\");\n\n        // Delegate call to target with all the arguments \n        (bool success,) = target.delegatecall(abi.encodePacked(msg.data));\n        require(success, \"Delegate call failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis contract uses a payable fallback function to delegate calls to a target address. The `delegatecall` function is used to execute code in the context of the calling contract, while preserving the contract\u2019s storage. In the case of failure, the operation reverts and the error message is returned.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example and might not cover all the potential security risks, especially when dealing with external calls and handling ether. Therefore, it is recommended to use well-known libraries (like OpenZeppelin) that provide secure and tested solutions for common operations.\n\nAlso, while working on real-world applications, it's crucial to follow best practices for smart contract development, which include thorough testing, code review, and security audits.",
