The fallback function is payable and updates `balanceOf1` to the current block number, `balanceOf` by the amount of ether received. If the balance of the caller is not zero, it transfers the calculated amount of ether to the caller. It also includes two extra functions to check the balance and the block number of the last transaction of an address.\n\nPlease be aware about the use of `fallback` function. It's needed to be careful since fallback functions are triggered when the function signature does not match any of the available in the contract. Be sure this is the behavior you want.",
