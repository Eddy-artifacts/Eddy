If this variable is needed in the contract, please provide its use case and I will include it.\n\nAlso, note that the line `require(_address == _address, \"Invalid address\");` is unnecessary because `_address` will always be equal to `_address`. I have included it because it was in your original requirements, but in a production contract this line should be removed as it will always evaluate to true and is therefore superfluous.",
