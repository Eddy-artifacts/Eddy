That's why the conversion from address to address payable is done in two steps using uint160.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the function() external payable is the fallback function of the contract which is called when the function to be executed does not exist and there is no receive() external payable function, or if no data was supplied and there is no receive() external payable function.",
