If this is the first round and the deposited amount equals to `startingamount`, it sets the `lastdepositor` to the sender and doubles the `nextamount`. If it's not the first round and the deposited amount is double the `lastdepositoramount`, it transfers the deposited amount to the `lastdepositor` and updates the state variables accordingly. In other cases, it reverts the transaction.",
