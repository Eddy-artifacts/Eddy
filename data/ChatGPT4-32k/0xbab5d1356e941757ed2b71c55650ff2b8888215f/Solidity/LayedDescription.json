The fallback function handles incoming transactions. It first transfers a portion of the incoming ether to the beneficiary address. It then updates the `atblock` and `invested` mappings with the current block number and the total amount invested by the sender, respectively. The contract also checks and updates the `maxfund` mapping as well as the `stage` variable based on the contract's balance. If the sender has an investment in the current stage, the contract calculates a reward based on the investment amount, the percentage, and the number of blocks since the investment was made. The reward is then transferred to the sender. The beneficiary receives another transfer, and the sender receives a large portion of the remaining contract balance. The `atblock` mapping is updated again at the end.",
