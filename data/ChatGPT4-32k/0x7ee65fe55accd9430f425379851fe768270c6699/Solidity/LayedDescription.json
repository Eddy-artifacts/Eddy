It can only be called if `decimals` is not 0.\n- The `setEtheraffle` function allows the owner to change the owner.\n- The `upgrade` function allows the owner to set `decimals` to 1 and call an external function `receiveEther` on a provided contract, with the value of the transaction being the balance of the contract.",
