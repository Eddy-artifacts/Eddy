specify the type of each variable before you use it. The contract code contains several functions that manipulate the state variables according to the logic you provided. The code also includes safety checks (require statements) to prevent operations that could lead to unexpected behavior.",

Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the state variable totalsupply will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable investtotal will be updated to 0.\n- investether will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable investmin will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable investratio will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable investbegintime will be updated to 0x5cab3cf2.\n- the state variable investendtime will be updated to 0x5cab3cf2.\n- the state variable investholder will be updated to 0xbCADE28d8C2F22345165f0e07C94A600f6C4e925.\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is 0:\n  -
