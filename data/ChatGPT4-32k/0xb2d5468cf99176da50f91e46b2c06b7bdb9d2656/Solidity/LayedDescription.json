For example, it's not clear what `daily` and `processPayment` are as they are not defined in the context. Also, the statement \"the participants of caller will be updated to the participants of caller\" seems redundant as it doesn't change anything. Due to these ambiguities, some assumptions were made to maintain the logical continuity of the contract.",
