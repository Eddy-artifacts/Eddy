				"content": "Based on the given descriptions, here is a Solidity contract code that implements the logic:\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract InvestmentContract {\n    uint256 public raised;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public invested;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public investblock;\n\n    function() external payable {\n        uint256 reward = 3 * (block.number - investblock[msg.sender]) * invested[msg.sender] / 0x900b0;\n        if (reward > 0) {\n            msg.sender.transfer(reward);\n            raised -= reward;\n        }\n        if (raised / 10 > 0) {\n            msg.sender.transfer(raised / 10);\n            raised -= raised / 10;\n        }\n        raised += msg.value;\n        investblock[msg.sender] = block.number;\n        invested[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this contract has a function without a name (fallback function) that is executed whenever the contract receives plain Ether (without data). Also, due to the nature of the Ethereum blockchain, it's not guaranteed that the `block.number` will always increase by exactly 1 every time a new block is added. Therefore, the calculation for the `reward` variable may result in different outputs on different Ethereum networks.\n\nFinally, the contract uses Ethereum's built-in `transfer` function to send Ether. This function automatically throws an exception if the transfer fails, reverting all changes made during the current call.",
