				"content": "Given the complexity of the contract logic, the contract code may look like the following:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract BountyContract {\n    string public name;\n    string public symbol;\n    uint256 public stakingrequirement;\n    uint32 private addressOfBountyMembers;\n    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceof;\n    mapping (address => uint256) public referralbalance_;\n    mapping (address => uint256) private balanceOf2;\n    mapping (address => uint256) public since;\n    uint256 public totalsupply;\n    uint256 private totalSupply2;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        // Your contract logic here\n    }\n\n    function fund() public payable {\n        if (totalsupply != 0) {\n            totalSupply2 = ((msg.value * 0x10000000000000000) / totalsupply) + totalSupply2;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() public {\n        uint256 amount = (((balanceof[msg.sender]*totalSupply2)-balanceOf2[msg.sender])/0x10000000000000000)+referralbalance_[msg.sender];\n        if (amount > 0) {\n            balanceOf2[msg.sender] = (((((balanceof[msg.sender]*totalSupply2)-balanceOf2[msg.sender])/0x10000000000000000)*0x10000000000000000)+balanceOf2[msg.sender]);\n            referralbalance_[msg.sender] = 0;\n            msg.sender.transfer(amount);\n        }\n    }\n\n    function exit() public {\n        // Your contract logic here\n    }\n\n    function sell(uint256 _amount) public {\n        // Your contract logic here\n    }\n}\n```\nThis is a skeleton of the contract, as the provided logic is incredibly complex and likely impractical for a real-world solidity contract. It is essential to ensure that the contract logic makes sense and is practical to implement in solidity. The SHA3 function is no longer available in recent versions of solidity and has been replaced with keccak256. Also, it's crucial to note that the \"and\" keyword doesn't work as bitwise AND in solidity as it does in Python, and it should be replaced with \"&\". Furthermore, it's important to remember that solidity doesn't support floating-point operations directly, so we need to handle them with integer operations.\n\nThe contract code outlined above provides a simple skeleton for a contract based on the given state variables and functions. You would need to add the specific logic for the constructor, exit, and sell functions based on your application requirements. In Solidity, we use the `msg.sender` keyword to represent the address of the caller, and `msg.value` to represent the amount of ether sent in a transaction. The `transfer` function is used to send ether from the contract to an address.",
