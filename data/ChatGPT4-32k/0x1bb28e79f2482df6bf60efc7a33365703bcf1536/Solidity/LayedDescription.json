It increases the balance of the sender in `hodlers` mapping by the amount of Ether received (msg.value).\n- `party() external payable` is the function that transfers back the Ether to the sender if the current timestamp is after 0x5f220d80 and if the sender has some balance in the `hodlers` mapping. After the transfer, the balance of the sender in the `hodlers` mapping gets reset to 0.",
