When the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0:\n    - it calls a built-in function ecrecover with the following argument list: SHA3(0x19457468657265756d205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a3332,v0), the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\nFor the payable deposit function.\n- When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the admin of caller) is not smaller than the ether just received (i.e., msg.value), and (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the admin of caller) is not smaller than the admin of caller:\n  - the admin of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the admin of caller).\n\nFor the withdrawToken function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the first argument is not 0, and the second argument is not greater than the balance from the first argument to caller, and the balance from the first argument to caller is not smaller than the second argument:\n  - the balance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the balance from the first argument to caller-the second argument).\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and the second argument.\n\nFor the payable availableVolume function, it has 10 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address, uint8, bytes32, bytes32.\n- it calls a built-in function sha256 with the following argument list: the address of this contract, the first argument, the second argument, the third argument, the fourth argument, the fifth argument, and the sixth argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n- When the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0:\n  - it calls a built-in function ecrecover with the following argument list: SHA3(0x19457468657265756d205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a3332,v0), the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `addressOfBountyMembers` is typed array,public state variable `admin` is typed uint160,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `orders` is typed mapping,public state variable `orderfills` is typed mapping,public state variable `tradefee` is typed uint256,public state variable `feespool` is typed uint256,public state variable `sharesaddress` is typed address,public state variable `gasfee` is typed uint256.\n ",
