It then transfers `msg.value / 5` to the contract `owner`. Next, it updates `balanceOf1[msg.sender]` with the current block number and adds `msg.value` to `balanceOf[msg.sender]`.\n\nIf `balanceOf[msg.sender]` is not equal to 0, the function calculates an amount based on the provided formula and transfers this amount to the sender. If any of the ether transfers fail, the function reverts the transaction.",
