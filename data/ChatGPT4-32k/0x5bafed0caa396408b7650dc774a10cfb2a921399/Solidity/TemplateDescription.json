The upgradeTo function allows the admin to change the implementation contract. The fallback function delegates all calls to the implementation contract. The adminFunction is a placeholder for functions that only the admin should call. The changeAdmin function allows the admin to transfer his role to another address. The upgradeToAndCall function allows the admin to upgrade the implementation contract and call a function on it in one transaction.",
