This function will get triggered when the contract receives Ether along with data that doesn't match any other function in the contract, or if no data was supplied at all.\n\nThe fallback function delegates the call to the contract at the `implementation` address. It does this using inline assembly for maximum efficiency. If the delegate call fails, it reverts all changes to the state and forwards the error message. If the call is successful, it returns the data returned by the call.",
