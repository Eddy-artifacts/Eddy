It also does not fully implement the provided description, due to its complexity and some ambiguous conditions.\nFor instance, the `doFishing` function only handles a subset of the paths described in the text, specifically the ones involving `_arg` values of `1`, `2`, and `3`. Other cases are not handled. \nThe contract also lacks events, modifier functions, and other common features of a production-grade smart contract. It is also not clear from the description what should happen in the case of a revert, i.e., if a transfer of ether fails. Therefore, the contract just uses a basic `require` to assert that the transfer was successful.\nPlease use this contract as a starting point and modify it to suit your needs.",
