				"content": "Here's a simplified version of a Solidity contract which includes most of the functionality described.

These functions include some of the logic described in the original description, but are simplified for clarity. Other functions described in the original description are more complex and have been omitted for brevity.",

Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n- the state variable totalsupply will be updated to 0x33b2e3c91efc989409c0000.\n- the state variable tokenpereth will be updated to 0x108b2a2c28029094000000.\n- the state variable valuetogive will be updated to 0x56bc75e2d63100000.\n- the state variable totaldistributed will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the approve function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is 0:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n- When the second argument is not 0, and the allowance from caller to the first argument is 0:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the withdraw function.\n- For owner:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to owner.\n\nFor the withdrawAltcoinTokens function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the first argument with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When RETURNDATASIZE is not smaller than 32:\n    - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: owner, and v0.\n\nFor the finishDistribution function.\n- When distributionfinished is 0, and for owner:\n  - the state variable distributionfinished will be updated to 1.\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When the third argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument, and the second argument is not 0, and the third argument is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller:\n  -
