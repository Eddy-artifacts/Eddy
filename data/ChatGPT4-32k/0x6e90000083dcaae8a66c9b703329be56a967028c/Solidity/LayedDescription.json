Some state variables are provided to help you develop.The following is the description of the contract logic: For the acceptOwnership function.\n- For newowner:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to newowner. Afterthat, \n    - the state variable newowner will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the approve function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the getPriceETH_USD function.\n- it delegates a call to the external contract token with the 0x57de26a4 argument.\n\nFor the transferAnyERC20Token function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: owner, and the second argument.\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable newowner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the burn function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the first argument is not greater than totalsupply:\n  - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the first argument).\n  - When the first argument is not greater than the balance of caller:\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-(the balance of caller-the first argument)).\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When the third argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - When the third argument is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller:\n    -

When the second argument is not greater than the balance of caller:\n    - When the address of this contract does not equal to the first argument:\n      - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n      -
