Additionally, `RETURNDATASIZE` operation was not used as it's not applicable in high-level Solidity. Also, the calculation of new `blocklockof` in `transfer` function with 2 arguments is not clear and seems to contradict itself in your description, so it was not implemented.\n\nPlease adjust the contract according to your needs and make sure to thoroughly test it before any use on a live network.",
