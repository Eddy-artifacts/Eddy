The contract includes a constructor that sets initial values, a function to change the owner, a function to update the wei per token, and a function to exchange tokens. \n\nPlease note that these functions include some checks and require statements for security reasons, such as checking if the transaction sender is the owner of the contract (only the owner can change ownership or update the wei per token value), or if token transfers were successful. \n\nAlso, make sure to replace the `IERC20` interface with the real interface of your `typetoken` contract.",
