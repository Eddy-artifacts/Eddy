The `withdraw` function transfers the `amountraised` amount of ether to the `crowdsalebeneficiary` and the `updateEtherCost` function allows the `crowdsaleowner` to update the `ethercost`. The `checkGoalReached` function checks the token balance of the `crowdsalewallet` and updates the state variables accordingly.",
