It has a balance for each user (`balanceof`), a total supply (`totalsupply`), and an allowance for each user to another user. The contract can buy and sell tokens, and also transfer tokens between users. The `fallback` function is used to receive Ether and buy tokens with it. The `sell` function is used to sell tokens and get Ether in return.",
