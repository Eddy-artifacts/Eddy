It also includes a constructor that sets the `owner` of the contract to the deployer. The `renounceOwnership` function allows the owner to renounce their ownership. The `manualSwap` function transfers the contract's balance to the `s_6_11_31` address under certain conditions. The `approve` function allows an address to approve another to spend a specified amount of tokens on its behalf. Note that each function includes a require statement to ensure the caller is the owner of the contract.",
