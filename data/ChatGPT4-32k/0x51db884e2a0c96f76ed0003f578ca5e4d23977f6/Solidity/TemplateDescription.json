The `transferPrimary` function allows the `primary` to transfer their role to another address. The `withdraw` function allows the `primary` to withdraw a specified `amount` to a specified `recipient`. The `deposit` function allows the `primary` to deposit an `amount` to a specified `depositor`'s balance (`depositsof`). The `sumstats` represents the total amount of all deposits.\n\nNote: Always be careful when dealing with arithmetic operations in Solidity, as they might lead to overflows/underflows. In this contract, I have added checks to prevent such situations, but in a real-world scenario, it is highly recommended to use a library like SafeMath to make arithmetic operations safe.",
