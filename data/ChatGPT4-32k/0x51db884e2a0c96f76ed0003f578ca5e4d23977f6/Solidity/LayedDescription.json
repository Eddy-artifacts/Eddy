The `transferPrimary` function allows the `primary` to transfer their role to a new address. The `withdraw` function allows the `primary` to withdraw ether from the contract. The `deposit` function allows the `primary` to deposit ether into the contract, and updates the `depositsof` mapping and `sumstats` variable accordingly.",
