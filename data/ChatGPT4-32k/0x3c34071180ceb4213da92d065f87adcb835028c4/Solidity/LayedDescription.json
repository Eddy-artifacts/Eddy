The `setOwner` function allows the owner to change the owner address. The `withdraw` function allows the owner to withdraw all the funds from the contract. The `setCut` function allows the owner to set the cut as long as it's between 0 and 10. The `listScam` function allows the owner to list a new scam for sale. The `buy` function allows a user to buy a scam.",
