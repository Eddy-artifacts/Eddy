				"content": "Based on your requirements, here's a Solidity contract that could work.

You need to implement the `ERC20Interface` and `tokenRecipient` for the `transferAnyERC20Token` and `approveAndCall` functions respectively.\n2. The described logic of SHA3 and its comparisons are not implemented because it seems to be pseudo code or not clear.\n3. The `symbol` and `name` are public strings and not integers, so `/` operator cannot be applied to them.\n4. There might be a need to adapt the contract to fit your needs and to thoroughly test it before using it in a production environment.",

Afterthat, \n    - the state variable newowner will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable newowner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the transferAnyERC20Token function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: owner, and the second argument.\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not greater than the balance of caller:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - When (the balance of the first argument+the second argument) is not smaller than the balance of the first argument:\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\nFor the approveAndCall function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, bytes.\n- When the third argument is not greater than 0x100000000:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n  - When 0 is not smaller than the third argument:\n    - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n  - When 0 is smaller than the third argument:\n    - When 32 is not smaller than the third argument:\n      - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n    - When 32 is smaller than the third argument:\n      - When 64 is not smaller than the third argument:\n        - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n      - When 64 is smaller than the third argument:\n        - When 96 is not smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n        - When 96 is smaller than the third argument:\n          - When 128 is not smaller than the third argument:\n            - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n          - When 160 is not smaller than the third argument, and 128 is smaller than the third argument:\n            - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When the third argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - When the third argument is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller:\n    - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n    - When (the balance of the second argument+the third argument) is not smaller than the balance of the second argument:\n      - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `newowner` is typed address,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,private state variable `s_5` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping.\n ",
