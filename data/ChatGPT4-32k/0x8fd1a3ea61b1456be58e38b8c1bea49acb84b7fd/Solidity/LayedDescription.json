The constructor is a special function that is executed during the creation of the contract and cannot be called afterwards. It's marked payable, which means that you can send Ether together with a call to this function.\n\nPlease note that the variable names totalSupply1 and totalSupply are quite similar and could potentially lead to confusion or bugs in a real contract. It's usually a good idea to choose distinct, descriptive names for your variables.",
