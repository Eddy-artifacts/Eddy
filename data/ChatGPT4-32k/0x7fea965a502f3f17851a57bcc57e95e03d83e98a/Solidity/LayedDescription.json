Some functions, especially those involving complex logic or external contract interactions, have been omitted for clarity. \n\nThis contract initializes `theao` to the address of the contract creator and sets `aodevteam1` and `aodevteam2` to the specified addresses. It also includes an `approve` method to set the allowance of a spender, and a `burnFrom` method that allows a spender to burn tokens from a specific address. \n\nYou should also note that the contract doesn't have any safety checks or events, which are usually crucial for a production-grade contract. This is just a basic example, and a real-world contract would be far more complex.",
