It includes the functions `order` and `cancelOrder` based on your instructions. This is just a basic implementation and you may need to add more checks and validations based on your specific requirements. Also, ensure to handle potential security issues such as reentrancy attacks and integer overflows/underflows. \n\nThe `sha3` function used in the contract is deprecated in the latest Solidity versions, and you may want to replace it with `keccak256`. Please also note that `ecrecover` returns an address, not a boolean, so you may need to adjust your logic accordingly.",
