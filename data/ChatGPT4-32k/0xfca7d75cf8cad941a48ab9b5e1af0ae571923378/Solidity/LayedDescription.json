When m_ownerfees does not equal to 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued (m_ownerfees-((m_ownerfees*15)/100)) to m_owner.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - it transfers ether valued ((m_ownerfees*15)/100) to partner.\n\nFor the ChangeAddressTrust function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, bool.\n- For users, except for the first argument:\n  - For m_owner:\n    - the trustedcontracts of the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n  - When the trustedcontracts of caller is not 0, and for users, except for m_owner:\n    - the trustedcontracts of the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `m_owner` is typed address,public state variable `partner` is typed address,public state variable `gladiatortopower` is typed mapping,public state variable `gladiatortocooldown` is typed mapping,public state variable `gladiatortoqueueposition` is typed mapping,public state variable `trustedcontracts` is typed mapping,public state variable `m_ownerfees` is typed uint256,public state variable `kinggladiator` is typed address,public state variable `oraclizecontract` is typed address,public state variable `queue` is typed array,private state variable `paused` is typed bool.\n ",
