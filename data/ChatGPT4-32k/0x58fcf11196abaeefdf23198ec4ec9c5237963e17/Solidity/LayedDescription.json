It also assumes that the `owner` of the contract is the one calling the `transferOwnership` function. \n\nPlease note that this is a simplified contract and doesn't include all safety checks and events which might be required for a production-ready contract. Moreover, the contract does not include the calls to the `isWhitelisted` function of the `whitelist` contract, as it was not explicitly described in the contract descriptions.",
