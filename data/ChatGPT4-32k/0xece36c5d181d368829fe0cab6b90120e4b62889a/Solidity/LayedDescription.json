Sets up the initial state for the token in the constructor. The token has a name, symbol, decimals, totalsupply, and an ICO with a specific ratio, start time, end time, sender, and holder.\n\n2. The `approve` function allows the owner of the contract to approve someone else to spend a certain amount of their tokens.\n\n3. The `withdraw` function allows the holder of the ICO to withdraw all the ETH from the contract.\n\n4. The `transferFrom` function allows someone to transfer tokens from one address to another, given they have the allowance to do so.\n\n5. The fallback function is payable and calls the `buyTokens` function, which allows someone to send ETH to the contract and receive tokens in return.\n\n6. The `transfer` function allows someone to transfer their tokens to another address.\n\n7. The `buyTokens` function allows someone to buy tokens at the ICO's ratio, as long as the ICO has enough tokens to sell.\n",
