Logic here ...\n    }\n\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value, bytes memory data) public {\n        // ... Logic here ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that you didn't provide the full logic for each function. For instance, you didn't specify what should happen if certain conditions are not met. Therefore, I only added placeholder comments where you should implement the logic. Additionally, you might want to add modifiers to restrict who can call certain functions (like `onlyOwner` or `onlyDev`) for better security. Let me know if there's anything else you need help with!",
