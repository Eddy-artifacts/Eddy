Some of the nested conditions and repeated actions you described were not included as they would not change the outcome of the functions. Also, the PlaceSellOrder function does not include a second argument as its purpose was not specified in the description. Furthermore, the function to calculate SHA3(caller,4) is not included as it is not clear how this should be implemented.",
