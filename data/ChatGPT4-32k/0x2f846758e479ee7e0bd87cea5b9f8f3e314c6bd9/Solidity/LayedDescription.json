It also includes a payable fallback function that, when the received ether equals a specific value and the `bet` state variable is true, calls the `userRollDice` function of the `etherwow` contract with the received ether and the sender's address as arguments. \n\nThe contract also includes two functions for the owner to set the `bet` state variable and the `etherwow` contract address. Both functions include a `require` statement to ensure only the owner can call them.\n\nFinally, the contract includes an interface for the `etherwow` contract, which allows the `BettingContract` to call the `userRollDice` function of `etherwow`.",
