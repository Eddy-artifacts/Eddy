				"content": "Please note that the given problem is not well-defined. The SHA3 hash function is not defined for numbers, instead, it is meant for strings. Also, getting the balance of a user is a function call in Solidity, not a variable. Lastly, the totalSupply1 and totalSupply variables should not be both private and public. The problem likely involves creating a token with specific logic, but the logic is not clearly defined. Here is a basic example of an ERC20 token contract in Solidity, which may serve as a starting point:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract MyToken {\n    string public name;\n    string public symbol;\n    uint8 public decimals;\n    uint256 public totalSupply;\n\n    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowance;\n\n    constructor(\n        string memory tokenName,\n        string memory tokenSymbol,\n        uint8 decimalUnits,\n        uint256 initialSupply\n    ) public {\n        name = tokenName;\n        symbol = tokenSymbol;\n        decimals = decimalUnits;\n        totalSupply = initialSupply;\n        balanceOf[msg.sender] = initialSupply;\n    }\n\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;\n        balanceOf[_to] += _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(_value <= balanceOf[_from]);\n        require(_value <= allowance[_from][msg.sender]);\n        balanceOf[_from] -= _value;\n        balanceOf[_to] += _value;\n        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract creates a basic ERC20 token with functions to transfer tokens, approve spending, and transfer from another address within the approved allowance. This is a simple token with no additional logic. Without a more specific problem, it's not possible to create a contract with the logic described.",
