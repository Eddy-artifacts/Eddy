The `owner` is the state variable that stores the address of the contract's owner.\n3. The `soldTokens` is the state variable that stores the number of tokens sold.\n4. The `token` is the state variable that stores the address of the token contract.\n5. The `constructor` is a special function that is executed during the creation of the contract. In the constructor function, the `owner` is set as the sender's address (`msg.sender`) and `soldTokens` is set to 0.\n6. The `transferOwnership` function takes a `newOwner` address as an argument. This function checks if the `newOwner` address is not zero and if the sender's address is the current owner. If these conditions are met, it sets the `owner` as the `newOwner`.",
