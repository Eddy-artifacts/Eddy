It also has methods to burn and mint tokens, as well as to transfer tokens. The burn function checks if the caller has enough balance before reducing the caller's balance and the total supply by the specified amount. The mint function checks if the contract has received enough Ether before increasing the total supply and the caller's balance by the specified amount. The transfer function checks if the caller has enough balance before reducing the caller's balance and increasing the recipient's balance by the specified amount.",
