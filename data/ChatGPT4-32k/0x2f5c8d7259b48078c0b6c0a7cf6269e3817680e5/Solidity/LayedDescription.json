Note that for the `withdrawTokens` and `fallback` functions, I assumed that the external contract you're interacting with is an ERC20 token and thus has a `transfer`, `balanceOf`, and `originBurn` function. If this is not the case, you will need to adjust the interface and these functions accordingly.",
