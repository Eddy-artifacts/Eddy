When this function is called, it will delegate the call to the target address with all the arguments (via `msg.data`). The `delegatecall` method returns a boolean value ('success') indicating whether the call was successful. If the call was not successful, the contract reverts with an error message.\n\nPlease beware that delegate calls can be dangerous because they execute code in the context of the calling contract, and this can lead to bugs and security vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.",
