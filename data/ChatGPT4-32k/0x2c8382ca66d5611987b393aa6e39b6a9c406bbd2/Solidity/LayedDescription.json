You need to provide an interface for it or an actual contract with the methods `balanceOf`, `transferWithoutChangeBest`, and `transfer`. I've assumed these are standard token methods, but you might need to adjust the code to the actual methods in your `tokenreward` contract. Also, the `safeWithdrawal` function assumes that the contract has enough ether balance to cover the withdrawal.",
