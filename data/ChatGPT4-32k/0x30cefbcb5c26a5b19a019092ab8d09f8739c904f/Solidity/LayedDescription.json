				"content": "Here is a simplified version of your contract written in Solidity language. However, due to the complexity of your contract description, it is impossible to write a fully working Solidity contract. Therefore, the following code is a simplified example that includes only a few of the functions you described:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract ExampleContract {\n    address public owner;\n    address public fundWallet;\n    address public newOwner;\n    uint256 public totalSupply;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;\n    \n    constructor() payable public {\n        owner = 0xF4b087Ad256ABC5BE11E0433B15Ed012c8AEC8B4;\n        fundWallet = 0xd6514387236595e080B97c8ead1cBF12f9a6Ab65;\n        totalSupply = 0xf8277896582678ac000000;\n        balanceOf[fundWallet] = totalSupply;\n    }\n\n    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;\n        balanceOf[_to] += _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value);\n        require(allowance[_from][msg.sender] >= _value);\n        balanceOf[_from] -= _value;\n        balanceOf[_to] += _value;\n        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        newOwner = _newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function acceptOwnership() public {\n        require(msg.sender == newOwner);\n        owner = newOwner;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract includes a constructor that sets the `totalSupply` and `balanceOf[fundWallet]` to a specific value and assigns the `owner` and `fundWallet` to specific addresses. The contract also includes `approve`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `changeOwner`, and `acceptOwnership` functions.",
