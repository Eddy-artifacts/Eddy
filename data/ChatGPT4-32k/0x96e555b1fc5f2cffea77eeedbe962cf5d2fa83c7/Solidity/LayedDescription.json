The fallback function accepts ether and updates `amountcontributedforredteam` or `amountcontributedforblueteam` based on whether the received ether amount is even or odd. The `contributeRed` and `contributeBlue` functions are also payable and update the corresponding state variables. The `claimDonation` function can only be called by the beneficiary and it transfers the contract's balance to the beneficiary.",
