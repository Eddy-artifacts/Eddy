This contract assumes that the token contract complies with the ERC20 standard.\n2. The `withdrawTokens` function uses low-level calls (`delegatecall` and `call`), which are potentially unsafe.\n3. You need to ensure that the contract at `contractAddress` implements the `balanceOf` and `transfer` functions with the correct signatures.\n4. The `kill` function will permanently destroy the contract and send all remaining Ether to the owner. This action is irreversible.",
