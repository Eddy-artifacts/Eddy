The constructor initializes the contract with the technicalrise address, the bidder who deploys the contract, the received ether, the timeout, and the fee rate. \n\nThe fallback function and fund function are designed to accept bids. They will calculate the fee based on the feerate, update the kbalance, and transfer the fee to the technicalrise address. \n\nDepending on the size of the bid, it will either extend the timeout by a fixed amount or calculate a new timeout based on the bid size. \n\nThe last bidder is updated if the bid is larger than a certain value, and if the timeout has passed, the remaining balance (kbalance - bid) is transferred to the last bidder, and the kbalance and timeout are updated.\n\nPlease note that the use of now in Solidity can be manipulated by miners, and for more secure timestamp usage, block.timestamp should be used.",
