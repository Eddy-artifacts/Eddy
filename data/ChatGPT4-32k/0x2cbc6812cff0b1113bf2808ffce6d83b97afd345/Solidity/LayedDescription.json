The contract uses the `payable` keyword for functions that are expected to receive Ether.\n\nThe `require` function is used to ensure that conditions are met before executing the function. If the condition inside `require` evaluates to `false`, the function will revert all changes and no gas will be consumed. The `transfer` function is used to send Ether from the contract to a specified address.",
