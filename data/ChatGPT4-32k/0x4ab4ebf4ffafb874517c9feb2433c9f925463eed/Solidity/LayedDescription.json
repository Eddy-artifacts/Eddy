Afterthat, \n    - the checkreferral of caller will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the updateReferral function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- For bountymanager:\n  - the checkreferral of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the checkreferral of the first argument).\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is not smaller than minimum:\n  - When the checkinvestments of caller is not greater than 0:\n    - the checkinvestments of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the checkinvestments of caller).\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to current time.\n    - When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100) is 0:\n      - it transfers ether valued 0 to ownerwallet.\n      - it transfers ether valued 0 to ownerwallet2.\n      - the state variable step will be updated to (1+step).\n    - When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100) is not 0:\n      - it transfers (5*(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100)) to ownerwallet.\n      - it transfers (5*(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100)) to ownerwallet2.\n      - the state variable step will be updated to (1+step).\n  - When 0 is smaller than the balance of caller, and the checkinvestments of caller is greater than 0:\n    - the checkinvestments of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the checkinvestments of caller).\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to current time.\n    - the checkwithdrawals of caller will be updated to 0.\n    - When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100) is 0:\n      - it transfers ether valued 0 to ownerwallet.\n      - it transfers ether valued 0 to ownerwallet2.\n      - the state variable step will be updated to (1+step).\n      - When (0-the checkwithdrawals of the address) is greater than 0, and (0-the checkwithdrawals of the address) is smaller than the balance of the address of this contract:\n        - it transfers ether valued 0 to ownerwallet.\n        - it transfers ether valued 0 to ownerwallet2.\n        - the state variable step will be updated to (1+step).\n        - When the checkinvestments of the address is not 0, and ((step*the checkinvestments of the address)/100) is 0:\n          - it transfers ether valued 0 to ownerwallet.\n          - it transfers ether valued 0 to ownerwallet2.\n          - the state variable step will be updated to (1+step).\n      - When the checkinvestments of the address is not 0, and (((((current time-the balance of the address)/60)*((step*the checkinvestments of the address)/100))/1440)-the checkwithdrawals of the address) is greater than 0, and ((step*the checkinvestments of the address)/100) is not 0, and (((((current time-the balance of the address)/60)*((step*the checkinvestments of the address)/100))/1440)-the checkwithdrawals of the address) is smaller than the balance of the address of this contract:\n        - it transfers ether valued 0 to ownerwallet.\n        - it transfers ether valued 0 to ownerwallet2.\n        - the state variable step will be updated to (1+step).\n    - When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100) is not 0:\n      - it transfers (5*(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100)) to ownerwallet.\n      - it transfers (5*(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100)) to ownerwallet2.\n      - the state variable step will be updated to (1+step).\n      - When (0-the checkwithdrawals of the address) is greater than 0, and (0-the checkwithdrawals of the address) is smaller than the balance of the address of this contract:\n        - it transfers (5*(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100)) to ownerwallet.\n        - it transfers (5*(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100)) to ownerwallet2.\n        - the state variable step will be updated to (1+step).\n        - When the checkinvestments of the address is not 0, and ((step*the checkinvestments of the address)/100) is 0:\n          - it transfers (5*(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100)) to ownerwallet.\n          - it transfers (5*(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/100)) to ownerwallet2.\n          - the state variable step will be updated to (1+step).\n    - When (0-the checkwithdrawals of the address) is greater than 0, and (0-the checkwithdrawals of the address) is smaller than the balance of the address of this contract:\n      - the checkwithdrawals of caller will be updated to ((0-the checkwithdrawals of the address)+the checkwithdrawals of caller).
