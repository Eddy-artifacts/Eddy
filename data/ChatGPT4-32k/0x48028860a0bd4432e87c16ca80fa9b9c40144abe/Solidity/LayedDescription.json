				"content": "Here is the contract code based on your description. Please note that in Solidity, you cannot directly change the input arguments. So I assume that the `s_1` of the first argument refers to an element in the mapping `s_1` indexed by the first argument.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address private s_0_12_32;\n    mapping(bytes32 => uint) private s_1;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        s_0_12_32 = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function newAccount(bytes32 arg) public payable {\n        require(msg.value > 0x9184e72a000, \"Not enough Ether provided.\");\n        if (s_1[arg] < 1) {\n            s_1[arg] = msg.value;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function deposit(bytes32 arg) public payable {\n        require(msg.value > 0x9184e72a000, \"Not enough Ether provided.\");\n        if (s_1[arg] > 1) {\n            s_1[arg] += msg.value;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a constructor that sets `s_0_12_32` to the address of the contract creator. The `newAccount` function accepts a `bytes32` argument and some Ether. If the value mapped to this argument in `s_1` is less than 1 and the sent Ether is more than `0x9184e72a000`, then the value of `s_1[arg]` is updated to the Ether sent. The `deposit` function works similarly, but it only updates `s_1[arg]` if its current value is more than 1.",
