The owner can set a new owner, set a reclaim period, or set a new backup owner. The backup owner can begin the reclaim process if the time left is zero. If the reclaim process is started, the backup owner has to wait until the reclaim period is over before they can become the new owner. The owner or any user (except for the backup) can reset the time left to zero. The backup owner can finalize the reclaim process and become the new owner if the time left is not zero and the current time is after the time left.",
