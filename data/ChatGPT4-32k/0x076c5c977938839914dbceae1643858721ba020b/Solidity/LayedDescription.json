Thus, the `balanceOf` mapping will always return 0 unless you add such functionality. Also, note that the contract's fallback function is payable and will increase the `totalSupply` state variable by the amount of Ether sent to the contract. However, this Ether cannot be withdrawn by the `withdraw` function because the `balanceOf` mapping is not affected by the fallback function.",
