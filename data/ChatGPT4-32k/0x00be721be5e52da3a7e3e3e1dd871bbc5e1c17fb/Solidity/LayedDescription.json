If the value sent with the deployment of the contract is 0, it sets the controller to the sender of the transaction and computes the initial last_hash.\n- The fallback function is also payable. Every time it gets called, it increments the round_count, computes a new last_hash and stores this hash in the mapping, _hash.\n- The spin function can only be called by the controller. It also increments the round_count, computes a new last_hash using the input argument and stores this hash in the mapping, _hash. It requires that the function caller is the controller.",
