The contract also includes a `withdrawMicroDivs` function, which allows the owner to withdraw all Ether from the contract. The `buyTokensWithProperEvent` function makes a call to an external contract's `balanceOf` function and `buyAndTransfer` function, passing relevant arguments. Please note that the external contract's functions signature and behaviour assumptions are based on the provided description.",
