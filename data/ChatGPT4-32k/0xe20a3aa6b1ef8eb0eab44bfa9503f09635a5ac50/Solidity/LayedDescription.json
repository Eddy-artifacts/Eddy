The constructor is payable and sets the `fomo_period` and `owner` state variables. The `renounceOwnership` function allows the owner to renounce their ownership. The `SetMLM` function allows the owner to set a new `owner2`. The `AddToBank` function allows `owner2` to add to the `balance`, set the `winner`, and set the `finish_time`. If the current time is past the `finish_time` and a `winner` is set, the `winner` receives the `balance`. The `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer ownership to a new owner.",
