This is because some of these conditions are contradictory and some of them are not clear enough. For example, the condition \"When the second argument is not greater than the balance of caller:\" is mentioned twice with different behaviors. So, it's not clear what should be the correct behavior. Also, the condition \"When currenttotalsupply is smaller than airdrop, and the balance2 of the first argument is 0, and currenttotalsupply is smaller than totalsupply:\" is not clear enough, because the variable \"balance2\" is not defined in your description. \n\nI recommend to clarify these conditions and to make sure that they are not contradictory.",
