it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n- When 0 is smaller than the third argument:\n  - When 32 is not smaller than the third argument:\n    - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n  - When 32 is smaller than the third argument:\n    - When 64 is not smaller than the third argument:\n      - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n    - When 64 is smaller than the third argument:\n      - When 96 is not smaller than the third argument:\n        - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n      - When 96 is smaller than the third argument:\n        - When 128 is not smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n        - When 128 is smaller than the third argument, and 160 is not smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n\nFor the sell function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the balance of caller is not smaller than the first argument, and the balance of the address of this contract is not smaller than (the first argument*sellprice), and (the balance of the address of this contract+the first argument) is greater than the balance of the address of this contract, and the frozenaccount of caller is 0, and the frozenaccount of the address of this contract is 0, and the address of this contract does not equal to 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the first argument).\n  - the balance of the address of this contract will be updated to (the balance of the address of this contract+the first argument).\n  - it transfers ether valued (the first argument*sellprice) to caller.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `sellprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `buyprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `frozenaccount` is typed mapping.\n ",
